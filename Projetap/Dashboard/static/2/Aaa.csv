1,Bunch of incompetence and making recommendationsThey recommended I need a new alternator after my car went dead. They also recommended another $3000 worth of work that I did not need.  It seems suspicious so I had to tow it out of there. My other mechanic tested the battery that AAA just put in and it was faulty. It also turned out I did not need a new alternator so the entire problem is fixed for less than $250. AAA wanted to charge me 3000+ then they didn’t even make an effort to make it right as I needed to be reimbursed for the faulty battery that they actually put in. . would not trust them with even a simple fix on your car,1,0.157,0.801,0.042,-0.942
2,Service is terribleService is terrible. I am a AAA North Penn Premier member and the one time I needed the service they were not able to provide it. My son was traveling from PA. to TX when he had a problem in Alabama at 1AM. After making innumerable calls to AAA and being put on hold and disconnected I was basically told they don't open in Alabama to 7 of 8 am and 24/7 really means nothing. I could try to find a outside cantractor and hope to be reimbursed from AAA. I will not renew my membership,1,0.06,0.876,0.064,0.0857

4,"AAA is not what it used to be :(This is no longer the same company of a generation ago. When you are stranded, you get an automated system that asks you to jump through hoop after hoop, one of which is to begin your roadside assistance process, yourself, on your phone. When you finally get through, it may be an hour and a half or two hours before a tow truck arrives. Because our phone number is from another state (that we lived in a decade ago), the system auto-routes us to that state, though I have asked to have it changed numerous times. If you break down in another state, there is not a reciprocal agreement, among AAA regions as to how many miles they will tow you, via your AAA agreement plan. Will it be the 3 miles Basic, or 100 miles Gold benefits? You do not know from state to state. I asked for a Gold membership and was given Basic, which ended up costing an extra $400 when we were out-of-state, stranded, and needed a tow.",1,0.042,0.936,0.022,-0.5508

He slid off the road 1 mile from home and requested the car be towed to our address. The dispatcher failed in communication and after 6 hours after the incident, his car ended up at this facility.  When his car was finally towed back, we were charged the over milage cost not only the 16 hours that passed. The car was returned with the drivers side window rolled down.

They also had the wrong date that this occurred, and called in prior to let them know, but still had the wrong date. Said no storms in the area when they googled it. Very rude. They came back saying that the damages came to 3,999, and my ded is 4k, so would not be covered.

I drove it in without any issues and when picked up, it was not drivable and we were told it needed a new engine! We had it towed and another mechanic replaced the timing guide/chain system, finding a multitude of shavings of metal/plastic in the oil pan. They asked if we drove it a while once it broke down. We told them we did not, that it was in another mechanics hands when the issue became known. They suggested we question ""What the he** happened"" on their watch?

AAA said dispatch took some pictures and determined that it “seems like” my car is total lost, has missing part (which is just no bumper btw), unregistered (which the front license plate just is in the car btw), not running, project car due to the car is lower (without any real evidence btw) so they refuse to provide the service because they said these are not covered in their policy. Based on what to make these assumptions exactly? They just created some ridiculous reasons to refuse providing services. I told them first of all it’s registered under my name, street legal, I can put the bumper on if needed but I got it towed many times without the bumper on. If the car is running fine, I don’t need a god damn fxxking tow to a shop to fix. The AAA rep. seriously said the car has to be running good in order for them to tow it. lol I’m speechless.

I have been a long time member but lately I am very disappointed with how this company disregards its customers. Never ever request AAA Assistance on a Sunday 2 separate times we requested service and waited more the 8 hours! Not 1-4 hours.. no,  I am talking 8 hours and spoke to a half a dozen customer service representatives all saying something different! The first person came on the phone and said that the extra charge will be an additional $100.00 to tow it an hour to get to my house because we reached our limit of tows for year. (We didn’t) So we paid it. Then another person calls saying there is no one available to get us so we will have to wait. Then another person calls saying it will be an additional $700.00 charge because it’s over an hour to tow to my house and that’s too far. (We didn’t pay it). Not to mention being broke down on a major highway for 8 hours (very dangerous) with no idea of how long a tow truck would arrive! Then when I did get a notification it was 6 hours later and apparently the tow truck driver was the only person working that day and was all the way on the other side of the state! ( That driver was very nice and I made sure to tip him and give him water for his trip back home being that he traveled so far to get us). The second time no one bothered to communicate with us at all after waiting 4 hours from first calling in requesting service. So we had to leave the car overnight in the parking lot and called again the next morning. Then the tow truck driver showed up within the hour with a negative attitude giving his big opinion about what he thought was wrong with the vehicle. Needless to say we didn’t need the additional stress. As it turned out it was nothing like what his big opinion stated but it was something very simple and was fixed in a couple of hours. If you ask me we should get credit for those 2 horrible experiences instead of having to pay for horrible treatment!

Instead the tech incapacitated my car by attaching the jumper leads in reverse, killing the battery and blowing fuses and left me stranded, to be towed to a mechanic after more waiting by the side of the road.AAA's actions left me without the use of my car for 5 days, and a nearly $700 repair bill. After one month, AAA offered to pay me $45 for the blown fuses. Really?If trust is what AAA selling, it's not working. Your motto is ""EXPECT SOMETHING MORE WITH AAA"" I don't think these actions reflect those values, just the opposite.

116,"I have AAAI have AAA. Friday night, Dec 29th, 2023, my car broke down on a drive to Hopkins MN, where I was taking the car to give back to the dealer due to a blown head gasket. I called AAA who in turn notified me that K&K Towing would be coming. My initial call was around 10:20p. I knew the night was going to get worse when a state trooper pulled up behind me under the guise of checking on me for safety. A 15 minute chat with the state trooper left me with the reality that I had 4 hours to get my car off the road or they would impound it. I was directed to a truck stop 8 miles further down the road. So with a blown head gasket, I continued to drive for an additional 8 miles pulling over every few minutes to let the the temperature return to normal. The truck stop was closed, but a little motel called Comfort Zone Inn was open. I paid for a room for the night so I could legally park my car in their lot. Around 2a Sat, 12/30/2023, my ride back home arrived. AAA was notified of my vehicles location, and the motel owner was advised that the tow would show up at some point, and that I would not need another day. I got back home around almost 3a. I sat up waiting for a text from AAA letting me know the car had been picked up but nothing ever came. I fell asleep at some point. Later that Saturday morning, the hotel called to say, the tow never arrived and my check out was at 11. Because eventhough I did not use the room I rented, I paid for the room to keep the car there for pickup. I call AAA who tells me a driver reached out around 8am and when they could not reach me by phone, they canceled the tow request. This all happened after setting up what AAA calls ""an unattended tow."" In other words I would not be present but the keys and vehicle would be awaiting pickup.  I had been assured several times, by AAA, that the tow truck driver would pickup the vehicle no matter what and I would receive a confirmation text when this was done. Instead, I'm notified the request was canceled because the driver could not reach me, eventhough I never canceled the request. Now it is 12:30p Saturday, and I am back at the Comfort Zone Inn, again waiting for K&K Towing. I made arrangements with the motel who allowed me continued use of their lot while waiting on AAA. At 5p, Leave Comfort Zone Inn because I have to go to work. I again confirm with AAA that I need an unattended tow. I explain, that I cannot use my phone while at work, but I need the car picked up regardless and to please not cancel my request again. When off work at 10p, I call AAA for a status update, only to then be told yet again the request was closed by K&K Towing and they would need to locate yet another company. Now here we are Sunday, 12/31/2023. For the 3rd time my tow request has been placed with K&K Towing. And for the 3rd time since Friday, 12/29/2023, K&K Towing canceled the request. And I'm sitting in a hotel parking lot awaiting a tow from AAA, throughout whomever company they contract with to tow my car the 194 miles back to the used car dealer who sold me a broken car & is willing to let me out of the contract if I get the car back to them, with no tow from AAA, multiple canceled requests and pretty much stuck up crap creek without a paddle. Why offer up to 200 miles of free Towing, AAA, if the company you give the job to, can simply decline the request? What am I paying for exactly? I don't care if I need to have my car towed to the moon, the point here is that I pay for a service through AAA. Then the tow company they send should have to come, or AAA should remove them as a reliable provider. One thing for sure is this. Once I get this figured out, I am canceling AAA & I am going to post my story over and over again on AAA & K&K Towing website. Because the bottom line here is this, AAA is not honoring there agreement, and K&K Towing ain't no better because even though they apparently service AAA, they only honor the requests if they feel like it.

The first time I called them we were broke on Thanksgiving afternoon in 18 degree weather on the shoulder of the road.  At first AAA told me they would have to get back with us with a towing service.  When they did they said it would be a least 2 -3 hours for them to tow us.  They suggested we call 911 as we were getting cold and it was starting to snow.  I did call the sheriffs department and they were going to send help our way.  In the meantime I was able to get a hold of a nearby friend who came to pick us up. I cancelled the officer, but let him know the tow truck was going to be several hours before they could get our vehicle.  While at our friend's I got a call from the towing company that they could come in the morning to pick it up.  Really?    So our friend took us home.  The next morning I call AAA to inquire about my vehicle, the towing service now can't find it!  Turns out, police had it towed to an impound lot!! AAA won't tow from the impound lot to repair shop!!!!  Of course its a long weekend and now I have to pay $468.00 to  Rapid Towing plus impound fee's!

No. They had me go and meet a service call that was cancelled hours earlier.

If you’re considering getting a membership or insurance with them, I highly recommend you DO NOT. Save yourself the headache and money. Worst auto insurance company by far.I canceled my membership today after several years with them. They refused to waive my deductible for an accident that wasn’t my fault, their list of towing companies is a joke, and they did not want to refund my membership because I used it once…ever. To be clear I paid for membership for years and used the service one time in that entire time period to tow my car from a shop to my residence 5 minutes away. “Our policy is that if you use our membership service once you cannot be refunded.” The one time I truly needed a tow I was far from home and it was late at night. I checked AAA’s membership list of towing companies and all the options weren’t available until the next morning. Why do we need to pay for membership when the membership can’t even provide real value? To add to all that, they upped my premium significantly when I bought a new car. There are way better companies out there. I found a  company that offered me 4 times the coverage for way less money.

They could sell me a battery and I would have to seek reimbursement from AAA.First, how can the emergency road tech tell me within five minutes, but the car care center would need four hours?

166,"Need a tow - you are last in line.   Pay insurance instead for towing/roadside help rider.AAA has a number on the card which then forces you to get to their digital assistant for 'quicker service'.  Forget that.   When you finally get that working on your phone then ask for a tow they'll ask if you had an accident.  If you did, then it tells you to call them.   Digital assistant means eliminating hard working Americans from jobs.  Humans cost money.  But it gets worse.  I can tell you how they operate from my experience.  AAA low balls towing companies and only covers first 7 miles in Texas.   Since the towing company knows they'll only get the bottom fee and can't jack you, then you'll get truck here in an hour.   Then truck is now expected in 2 hours.   Then truck now expected in 3 hours.   Finally you get disgusted and call your own truck.  AAA has now cheated you out of your membership and covering their responsibilities.   What is happening is that the tow truck operator gets a call and figures, ah..I can charge this guy $269.   So you have to wait.   Then the next guy calls.  Another $269.   So you keep waiting and waiting and waiting while cash customers (not AAA suckers) pony up.   When I called for a truck they didn't tell me price.  I called the nearest truck.  $269.  I said forget that - $150 - you are going 4 miles.  Boss says cash only, friend takes me to ATM. Done.   Point is AAA cheats operators by not paying them enough to make you a priority and probably recruits by telling operators they'll get plenty of business to keep the trucks running.  They cheat you because they either won't show or you are the last priority for a tow.   Its obvious what happens.  Tow operators want the referral but if anything worth more comes their way they are taking it, and frankly I probably would too considering the dangers and liabilities.   When I called to cancel that call went right through and they had zero interest in hearing what I had to say.   So...I am saying it here.   Forget AAA.  They are nothing what they used to be.  Same as businesses everywhere.   Some private equity firm buys them up, or they hire some business manager who figures out how can we squeeze every dime out.    If you can justify the discounts they might be able to get you for the cost of your membership then do it for that.   But as far as any real help.   Forget it.

178,DisturbingI just took out a membership for myself my husband and my daughter. I had a flat tire front passenger side. I had to wait 3 hours for someone to change my tire. I was paying monthly they told me in order to get towed because it was within 7 days I had to pay over $200 to pay for the rest of the year plus a $70 fee to come out. Done here to wait 3 hours and the guy that came out wanted me to pull across a bridge even though my tire was totally flat and I told him it would ruin the rim of my vehicle. He had me angle my car into the road which to me was crazy dangerous and then he pulled his vehicle behind me. This whole experience is horrendous. I asked if I could cancel our memberships they told me no you have to wait a year. When I called two people found me in the computer and mysteriously both of them hung up on me as I'm on the side of the road. The third person I contacted could not even find me in the computer. Finally a gentleman came on the line and took care of me and explained that they had to charge me all this money because the girl that did everything was new and she wasn't aware of things. then when I called to let them know it's been a few hours and I don't know what's going on but the worst part was I had a diabetic person in my vehicle. Then ended up uncontrollably shaking and vomiting. If we would have been taken care of when we were supposed to none of that would have had to happen. So after that we were told 23 minutes then we were told an additional 22 minutes then after I explained to them about my passenger being diabetic they said I could leave the vehicle. Where would they like us to go in the middle of nowhere. I have never in my life ever experienced something like this. So now the last person said because we waited so long they would cover the tow. So let's see tomorrow if I can get my $70 back. I think we all know what that answer will be. So I am doing reviews on every single thing I could find so nobody else ever goes through this again. This is the worst experience I have ever had and how scary when you have a diabetic in your car you have to wait 3 hours in the middle of nowhere. So I will make sure everyone is aware of this and how the process works and how if I didn't have my debit card to pay over $200 I would have never gotten towed. So I hope everybody thinks twice about picking this pathetic company this could have ended up very dangerous and no matter who I spoke to on the phone could give two craps.,1,0.099,0.859,0.042,-0.978

187,"DO NOT TRUST A Car Repair Shop Just Because it has AAA on its advertisements!DO not believe what AAA claims in regards to their Car Repair shops. Take the time to read all they claim their members will get if they choose one of their shops. I fell for it and boy was I ever sorry. The mechanic wouldn't honor any of their advertised 'perks'-24 month warranty on work/parts, 10%discount up to $70 on labor, ASE certified auto techs (absolutely no way), and finally AAA 'stepping in' to mitigate any disputes that may arise. My car was overheating. I called AAA shop and was told by owner he would diagnose my car,  call me to discuss and would have estimate prepared for me to read. He called me to say I needed a new radiator for $800. I questioned this fix since it hadn't been very long since my Lexus had a new radiator installed. But I was at the mechanics mercy. I was 1 1/2 hour away from home when all this happened. I just wanted my car repaired. I was never given an estimate even after I asked for one. I agreed to radiator, paid owner, drove off lot & car immediately overheated again. I pulled over,  called mechanic to update and to have my car towed back to his shop. He refused to allow this. He said there was nothing wrong with my car. He told me to drive it slowly with the heater turned all the way up. Park car & fill up with coolant the next a.m. Not knowing what to do and feeling I should trust this AAA mechanic, I did as he instructed. The next day I had my car towed to my local mechanic. He couldn't believe his eyes. He knew my car was kept in tip top shape. He said my car should never have been driven because it was diagnosed with a code PO302. He pointed to it on the sparsely written invoice. I then saw it ""Found code PO302, cylinder 2 misfiring, overheating can ruin head gaskets."" He also said that it should have been fixed immediately although it is notoriously difficult to diagnose and usually takes many steps to figure out what is truly causing car to overheat. He said the mechanic showed total disregard for my safety or the wellbeing of my car by sending me out on the freeway at night knowing the car had shown a PO302. He said my car was badly burned and it needs a new engine. It is ruined.I did call the shop owner and asked about the 24 month warranty he has advertised. He chuckled and said ""I don't do that warranty. Mayby AAA will honor it but I won't. I'll give you 60 days."" But again I tried to make an appointment to drive it back to his shop so he could repair it correctly but he flatly refused to allow me to do this. He kept saying there was nothing wrong with my car! I did call the area manager of the AAA shops and he was very condescending. He didn't offer help of any type. He said  ""Well he did attempt to repair your car and he did install a new thermostat at no charge."" Yes but that is not what my car needed. I had just installed a new thermostat. No one ever called me to say ""Hey I'm going to guess again and this time I'm going to give you a new thermostat even if that doesn't work and there is no reason to put a new one in your car."" No he never mentioned a new thermostat to me. That mechanic thought he could guess what was wrong with my car and he didn't guess correctly. I feel this is one of the most misleading and dishonest companies in the United States. People foolishly feel that if AAA is attached to a service then the service will be superior and this is simply not true.  So when you see an auto repair shop showing they are associated with AAA, remember my story & perhaps try to find another repair shop. AAA does not care. I certainly don't believe they insist every tech working at these shops gets the special ASE training. The tech I spoke with couldn't or wouldn't tell me anything about what they did to my car.  Also I highly doubt shops have to go through 'rigorous inspections, etc.' in order to have AAA advertised on their literature. It is all false advertising and obviously these shops know AAA is not going to make them stand behind all they claim so there is no threat to the mechanic and/or his shop.

They then gave me a ride home where I got in my other vehicle to go try to charge my battery enough to close the power windows and locks. Called and requested a tow again the next morning.

But, it is the worst.  12 am, my vehicle runs hot on a deserted stretch of I22.   I promptly pull off the interstate and park at the end of the off-ramp.  It is the middle of nowhere and I’m not from that area.   But, I know there are some issues in that county.   I’m worried about being hit from behind and or criminal activity in the deserted area.  AAA said they’d get a tow truck to us and the police.  AAA, cancels the first call and sends text to the alternate number I gave just in case my phone loses service, only had one or two bars.   I finally see text, call back.   They say they cannot get anybody,and basically that I am on my own.  That is the service I pay for and it is completely unacceptable!   At, this point, customer service is mad and rude.   I’m mad because they are not doing their job.   We find (with our limited cell service) a tow company in the area that is a AAA contractor that can come and we have talked to that company.  AAA says they’ll set it up after we give company name, phone number, and details.   We wait.   I’ve called my brother from over an hour away. We waited, no one shows up.   We call AAA back and they say the tow company denied the call, customer service gets even more hateful and say they’ve addressed the issue.  I tell them no, you have not addressed the issue.  If it was addressed, there’d be a tow truck here and getting us on our way and police would be here as you said (police never showed-I have no faith they ever even called them).   We called Dora police dispatch.  They said the company we found is a AAA contractor and he got that company to us.   The driver said they did not deny the claim.   He said it was AAA cancelled it because he told them he was the only driver available (people off and on vacation etc…), he could only take it to Jasper not Fultondale.   Which was okay and we had already found a service center to accommodate all parties.   And, it was a closer place.  AAA just didn’t want to do the service.   Tow truck driver said we have two options, call AAA back and get them to cover the claim as they should or pay it ($125) and file a claim with AAA.   I have no faith that AAA will pay a claim.   I had to get back on the phone with AAA.  AAA transferred me to dispatch, they wouldn’t answer the phone because they recognized the number.   Then they hung up on me.   I called back and had someone else call at the same time.   This made them even more mad.   Simply do your job and you will not be mad.  Customer service was even more rude.   We finally get them to send the authorization to the driver and he gets us to the repair company.   We finally made it home about 5:30 am.   And, this is the “Cliff’s Notes” version.

228,"wish I could put 0 starsA policy holder with AAA hit my car, and since then I have had to jump through 100 hoops trying to get ahold of them. Not once did Robin Picciolo ever call me back, and as kind as I was with my voicemails and calls - she seemed very irritated when she did finally answer after days of calling and leaving messages. She also hung up on me twice, maybe she thought our call was over, but she did not even give me a chance to ask my last questions - as soon as I said thank you for one thing, she hung up on me - twice. I would say she is horrible and should be fired, but from all else that I've read about this company - maybe that is their criteria! They tried to extremely low ball me for my injury settlement, and did not send me enough money to cover the rental for my vehicle while it was being repaired due to one of their policy holders crashing into my car. She got annoyed when I (very kindly and politely, might I add) request that they give me enough to cover the costs. My car is a Hyundai Elantra 2023 sedan, and the rental they would cover is an old Nissan. Also, I have to pay the deposit for it, even though I am not at fault for this accident - I keep having to come out of pocket for all the running around and this is very stressful and time consuming on my end. I understand they may be short staffed, as she stated she has 19 other people to call. At least she is calling them! She never called me back once. It's been 11 days since the incident and she nor her supervisor have ever returned a call to me. It's very important to know I am not some rude person who was deserving of being ignored. I am a student who has enough going on and understand people need empathy and kindness, I was so kind and well mannered with my voicemails to them requesting call backs and help. I have heard stories about insurance companies being ""evil"" and I never had any reason to believe those stories until now. In my experience with AAA, it's true. They are horrible. Lucky for me, I have Geico! Maybe if you crash into other's cars often, AAA might be a good fit for you as they don't want to help the parties who are not at fault AT ALL. Horrible company.

I called customer service several times and was put on hold, disconnected and promised service was on its way numerous times that never came. Some of the service people were rude and dismissive, AAA claims that the safety of their customers is their number one priority. That's a lie. I was stuck on a highway at the end of a bridge with high speed traffic that came dangerously close. When I told them that changed nothing. No one called to see how I was, no one called the next day to follow up. On one of my calls to AAA to check on the status of my service call I found out that there was an extra three hours added to my wait. No one called to tell me that. If I hadn't called I wouldn't have known, I finally had to reach out to the towing company myself. I found out that AAA had ignored my repeated instructions as to exactly where my car broke down and instead gave them an address a mile away. If I hadn't called the towing company myself, they never would have come. Meanwhile my cell phone battery was draining and I almost ran out of power. It's disconcerting that this company is still operating. At best they cause a tremendous amount of stress and at worse they put lives in danger.I've been a member for many years, and at one time sang their praises.

I called for services at 3:19pm regarding this requesting service. They texted me a message saying someone would be there around 4:19pm. No one called, no one showed up. Each time I called to check the time it would change, it is now 6:45 PM and no one has called or showed up. This is absolutely ridiculous,  and anyone with an ounce of sense knows that from 3:19 pm to 6:45pm waiting to get a flat changed is not fair to me as YOUR CUSTOMER.  I had to call my husband who has one (1) leg, a Disabled Veteran and we had to change the tire ourselves.  This is unacceptable. I am an Insulin Dependent  Diabetic, using the insulin pump.  I had to purchase a candy bar from the store so that my blood sugar would not drop any lower.

Our reason for purchasing this service was because of our disabilities. My family members that have this service I will be encouraging them to NEVER renew their membership again because the service they will receive is NOTHING if they need service in Detroit. I'm calling the radio station and ask the question of how many people have gone thru this same thing. Don't bother sending renewal papers here for next year, they will be returned to SENDER, NO LONGER NEEDED, SO DONT WASTE YOUR POSTAGE NOR YOUR PAPER.

Luckily, it was in a YMCA parking lot and she could go in there.  It is 6:16 PM.  She left the keys under her car mat and left the car there and it still hasn't been picked up.

It used to be doggone good service, now it's just dog crap.  Update: At 7:30 PM, my wife called the towing company and was told the vehicle was being loaded at that moment.

245,"AAA refusing to compensate for their own errorA week and a half ago, I reached out to AAA roadside service for a battery test/recharge/possible purchase on a vehicle that had started. This was something that has happened before, they came and tested the battery, offered to sell me a new one, and install it on site, and it went smoothly. However, this time, it went differently. The technician informed me that he can sell me a battery and install it for $190 after testing it, per usual and this is what I was expecting it to do. He jumped my battery, and read the test. He informed me the battery had a low charge, and that I needed to let it run OR go to a mechanic for it to be charged. He stated something was draining it, and he informed me everything else was fine, and left without giving me a chance to buy a battery. I then took it to a mechanic, and they discovered the battery was dead. Changed the battery, and charged me a total of $335. Considering all I wanted was to pay the $190 for the battery sold by the AAA tech, and his failure to do so, I had hoped I could get reimbursed the difference. Had he sold me the battery as I expected, I wouldn't have been out the extra $145. I sent the reimbursement request with this information, and received a call back from a woman, whose name i will leave off of this review. She explained that they don't do reimbursement for service and that I don't have a AAA battery. Of course not. That's my issue. I should have had a AAA battery. I explained the situation and she reiterated the same thing, and told me that all he could have done is put in a new battery, but I would still have to pay around $190 for it. I explained to her that I am aware of that, and that I WANTED to do that, and reiterated that he left without selling me a battery, and told me the battery was fine and I should go to the mechanic to recharge it, or drive it for an hour. She informed me that his test came back inconclusive, and that he was only able to determine that the battery had a low charge. Due to in inconclusive nature of the test, he was unable to determine what was wrong, and if I even needed a battery. In that case, their technicians recommended going to a mechanic for w further diagnosis. She reiterated that they don't reimburse for service, and that he could have sold me a battery ""but you would have to pay for it"". Which she reiterated about 5 times during our call. And I reiterated, about 5 times, that I was aware of that, and that I WANTED to purchase the battery from him. I also explained to her that he provided none of the details she just gave me. I reiterated that all he told me is that the battery was drained, it needs a recharge, and that his test shows that everything with the battery is ""fine"", and he left without giving me a chance to buy the battery, and suggested I just get the drained battery recharged because something drained the battery. I explained that his lack of communication, his incorrect information and and his lack of battery sale cost me $145 extra, when, had he done his job, he would have sold me the battery for $190 then and there.I explained that I had hoped for the difference to be reimbursed since this was on the technician's lack of communication. Considering her constantly informing me that I would have had to pay for the battery regardless, and my constant reiteration that this is what I wanted, but he didn't offer it to me, I got the impression that she was not listening, and thought I wanted a full reimbursement. All I wanted a differential reimbursement for the extra money I had to pay due to the technician not doing his job, not communicating, and not selling me the battery he was supposed to sell me",1,0.078,0.9,0.022,-0.9827
246,“Roadside Assistance” is misleading“Roadside Assistance” is misleading! My car got a flat tire. I called to get emergency roadside assistance. A tow truck was confirmed. A few hours later it was cancelled. I called again the next day and was confirmed a tow truck. Once again that called me a few hours later stating the tow truck was cancelled. I was told to coordinate a private towing company to pick up my car and then apply for reimbursement. At this point it was too late for me to get a private tow truck company. It’s now been four days and I still cannot get my car. AAA is stating that I cannot confirm tow services because the towing has not been paid for and not available on the side of the street. The tow yard won’t let me pay until they see a tow truck at their location. Basically because AAA left me hanging to deal with towing my car out of the way of traffic I’m stuck with paying over $700 from private tow companies. They insist that I can submit my receipts for a refund “consideration”. This is the worst paid membership I’ve experienced. You’re literally paying to waste your time and to be subjected to misinformation. They will keep telling you to hire a private tow truck for reimbursement BUT they won’t tell you that the reimbursement is for ONLY one trip.

247,"Customer Service???  Common Sense???I have had AAA for several years.  As far as towing goes they do alright, the rest of it is a joke.  They replaced my battery in my 2015 Dodge Journey.  I got the one with a three year replacement warranty.  If you are familiar with the Dodge Journey you know that you have to remove the right front tire to replace the battery, I know go figure.  About 14 months later the battery goes out on me, and also if you are familiar with this wonderful car you also know it will not run with a dead battery, even if you jump it.  With that said I decided to remove the battery as the technician last time said he could not do it.  I figured that they could just bring me the replacement battery.  Once they finally answered the phone I was informed that first off they do not offer battery service to my location.  Town of 80,000 people no less.  I was also informed that removing the battery voids the warranty.  Now living in Arizona I have had to replace countless batteries and many of them were replaced via warranty, this is the first time I was ever told they will not honor the warranty because I removed the battery.  They told me it would have been better for them to tow it 50 miles to the shop, wait for two days till they can replace it, and then have me drive 50 miles to go and pick it up again.

I tried to use the AAA website but found it impossible. So, I called AAA. They provided a ""more convenient"" link through a text message so I wouldn't have to wait in the queue. That wasted a bit of time--it doesn't work. So, I called again, but the person on the other end said I would have to call on Saturday since they can't schedule more than two days in advance. I called Saturday, and an hour later a tow truck was in my driveway. I explained that the shop didn't want my car over the weekend, so he said is was no problem and they would come Monday morning. On Monday morning, my phone beeped, and AAA had somehow bypassed my phone and gone directly to voicemail. The voice that was hard to understand said Bill's Towing would be out shortly and they would call before coming. I didn't feel comfortable with that, so I called Bill's Towing. The dispatcher said he had no call on record from AAA. I called AAA, and got past the robot to talk to a person who told me Bill's Towing had a ticket to call me. I told her they have no record. She said she would send a message to the AAA dispatcher to make sure someone was coming, and AAA would call me. I called Bill's Towing again, and the Bill's Towing dispatcher had no record of a AAA ticket for my tow. About ten minutes later, Brown's Towing truck came down my driveway.

My wife encountered a flat tire while I was at work, and she patiently waited for assistance for a staggering two hours. Frustrated with the delay, she eventually took matters into her own hands and decided to fix the flat herself.To add insult to injury, Domar Automotive, the company dispatched by Aaa, only made excuses and failed to provide the timely assistance we expected. Shockingly, my wife noticed a technician from Domar Automotive sitting across the street from her, seemingly doing nothing to help. This lack of action and accountability from the technician and the company is simply unacceptable.As a long-time customer of Aaa, I have always relied on their prompt and efficient service. However, this recent incident has shattered my confidence in their ability to deliver on their promises. When emergencies arise, it is crucial to have a dependable service provider that can be counted on to provide timely assistance. Unfortunately, Aaa failed to meet this expectation.Considering the disappointing experience and the lack of reliability demonstrated by Aaa and their chosen partner, Domar Automotive, I have made the decision not to renew my service with Aaa. It is disheartening to see a company that was once dependable and trustworthy fall short in such a significant way.I hope that Aaa takes this feedback seriously and works towards improving their service quality and reliability. Customers should be able to depend on them during times of need, and it is essential for Aaa to regain the trust of their customers.",1,0.168,0.748,0.085,-0.9718

If you slam on breaks to avoid totaling your car because a deer jumps in front of your car your score drops. If you mildly accelerate to 15 mph to start merging with traffic doing 25 you get dinged for heavy acceleration. When you talk to customer service about these things they say it doesn’t matter as long as you get the trips and miles in which is bull because my local rep says I have to stay above 74 to keep discounts.

My car stalled out and I called AAA at 1:57 p.m. August 21. I received a text with a time that the truck would arrive, 2:33 p.m. When it didn’t arrive, I called back and was told 2:48. A follow up call for an update netted “we can’t tell you when to expect the truck”.Called again when it didn’t arrive as promised and was told it was on a police call and the wait would now be an hour. 3:48, still no towing truck. Follow up again and was told it would be another hour. Around 4:30 I called and was told that someone would be there in 10 to 15 minutes. Called back 20 minutes later and was told the service was on a police call and would not be there for an hour.BACK TO THE BEGINNING!!!!Finally decided to take a chance and try to make it back to Hyundai on Perryville. With my spouse following in case something happened. The problem was unreliability, the car would stall out and not start for a long time. Luckily we made it to the repair place. AND decided to treat ourselves to dinner after the ordeal.At a restaurant at 6 p.m., four hours after the initial call to AAA the towing company finally called, they couldn’t find the care. I told them we left. I explained the chronology; the dispatcher she was apologetic. They DID NOT RECEIVE THE INFORMATION UNTIL 3:40 P.M. !!!!!!! Almost two hours after my initial call. The towing company was a new AAA provider. Recent experience brought to light that AAAs new system has huge problems with timely distribution of information. It turns out the longest we might have had to wait was 2 hours.I see several problems with your shoddy service as a consumer or victim of it.1.    The dishonesty of the customer service people re: their promising when the people would be there after presumably calling the service. Checked with the towing company to verify the source of the problem. Learned the towing company not received any calls for updates from AAA...I can only surmise the hold time was them just pretending to get information. 2.    Rather than having a queue that is all inclusive the next customer in line gets the next available service provider, I was stuck with a provider who was supposedly on a police call and delayed for an hour. I was told if I wanted to “start the process over the wait will be longer because you’ll be at the back of the line”.3.    The last suggestion was that I leave the keys with the car “most people put them under the front floor mat” and get a ride home. Since my car started at times, I asked if AAA took responsibility if it was stolen. I was told AAA had no responsibility until it was in the hands of their service.Received a response this morning.

276,"Extremely Dangerous Driver for AAA!!On July 21, 2023 around 2pm I was travelling north down New State Road in Manchester, CT when a driver of a AAA flatbed pulled out of Hilliard Street, I saw him look to the right and looked to the left, saw my vehicle too close for him to pull out andhe did so anyway. I hit the brakes and had to make a pretty abrupt stop. I beeped my horn as I started braking and the driver flipped me the middle finger while laughing. This at an intersection where many accidents happen (contact the Manchester CT police dept to find that information), one a year and a half ago where a 15 year old girl was killed in an auto accident. And their driver takes such irresponsible, arroagent risks and has zero respect for the general public. After I started up again, I turned around, caught up with their AAA flatbed vehicle and got a photo of it and the GMC truck they were towing. The vehicle plate #BA-85410. Their driver had zero regard for other human life, if that road was wet, if a driver was behind me had hit me, my car would have ended up in the back driver's side wheel of the flatbed. It was that close!! In following up I was told that any disiplinary action is propriatary and not something that is divulged to the public. I did not ask nor would I want any personal information about the driver, as I'd not want him or anyone knowing mine. The fact is that the public and a person particularly who was nearly involved in an accident with their vehicle should have a right to know what disciplinary action is being taken to ensure this will never happen again. If he's fired or given a written warning, furloughed for a week as a disciplinary action regardless of their policies should be given to the person involved. It's shocking their policy is zero transparency when their driver driving their vehicle with the logo emblazened on the side of the truck and was an absolute danger on the road!! This is a company who is supposed to be built on ""road safety""!! They care nothing about the public or safety, so long as they provide lip service and nothing as information goes about their disciplinary actions are concerned.

She was told they would send someone out to meet her.  She called repeatedly to get an update on the driver and was told each time that they were sending someone out, and she waited with her car running so she could have AC in the 99 degree heat for FIVE HOURS and finally went home. After she got home, they called her and she went back out there to meet them.  A sub driver, hired by AAA came out and helped her and told her that AAA lies to their customers and if they had called him earlier in the day he could have helped her and prevented her from waiting so long.

304,"If I could give them no stars I wouldIf I could give them no stars I would. I have had them for over 4 years and the service has been horrible for the last year. Last August, we had a flat tire and, because we were supposedly broken down on a highway that they did not service, I ended up spending #200+ to have my car towed myself ON vacation. Fine- it happens. About 2 months ago, the car broke down AGAIN with my husband and 9-year-old son on the side of the road after 9 pm. I called AAA and spoke to someone who sounded like I woke them up. Set up a tow and was told they did not have an ETA but we would be texted once the driver was en route. An hour and a half later - NOTHING. I Called back - they had NO record of the prior call. We had to set up ANOTHER tow and I was advised that we could wait another 1-2 hours. An hour later and call#3 -now midnight- was told that the driver was behind in that area and unable to give ETA. Was told nothing to do but wait. After a 4th call - and another hour at 1 am, the husband was advised that he could leave the car with the key under the mat and unlocked. They still had no clue when the driver would be out. They offered a $20 rideshare coupon so he could get home with my son - for a $40 ride. I called a 5th time - because I KNOW Their Policy about cars needing to be with someone when the tow shows up and was told it was fine- that the driver would be notified and would pick it up. The next morning, when I still had heard NOTHING from AAA or their tow truck driver - I called the shop where it was supposed to have been taken. Guess what? CAN'T FIND IT. I Spent an entire day chasing down my only car only to discover that the driver came out and left it because no one was with it. In total, between the night of the service call and the next day, I had made ELEVEN calls to their support- half of which I was told they had no record of - and by 5 pm had FINALLY located my vehicle. Fast forward to now - Purchased a new car that comes with roadside assistance for the next 2 years. Call AAA to cancel the account (my mother who pays for the service with her own credit card in HER NAME). Was advised on call#1 - Cancellation team is not available to take the call and offered a call back which she accepted. FIVE days later- no callback and the service renews and the card is charged. Mother calls a second time on 8/4 and was told after an hour that the service could NOT be canceled by her because the account was in MY name AND that no refund could be issued anyway. I call the same day and was again told that no one was available from the ""cancellation team"" to take the call- offered a call back which I accepted. It took them FIVE DAYS to call me back. On 8/9 I explain all of this and am told that they need a manager - because they cannot provide a refund but can cancel the service. Was promised a call back by 5-5:30. That time came and went. At 7 pm, I receive the call and am advised that they searched all the calls for the days before we called on 8/4 and located no calls except my call in May (ONE CALL MENTIONED AS LOCATED NOT THE 11 THAT I MADE) and because of that - no refund will be given but the service is canceled. UNACCEPTABLE service - not worth a full $1 let alone $213/year. STAY AWAY - Most insurance plans offer roadside assistance that is competent and complete.

316,"UselessI've had to actually use AAA twice. Both were horror stories in customer service.The first time, I was a passenger in a car that broke down on the interstate. We sat on the side of the interstate for 4 hours waiting for AAA... FOUR hours! The whole time we're just waiting for some idiot who's  texting and driving to slam into us. This was in a densely populated Chicago area. We kept calling and AAA kept saying help was on the way. Afterwards, their excuse was that we happened to break down on the border of two counties, so they couldn't figure out who to send. WHAT???The second time was when my daughter had a flat tire in rural-ish area. It was fairly late in the evening, and nobody showed up after 2 hours. Luckily, it happened at a friend's house, so she told them that she was going to bed and would try again in the morning. In the morning, it was the same story: after 2 hours, nobody had shown up. After waiting on hold due to ""heavy call volumes"" (on a Sunday morning at 8am???), she finally got through (to a friendly rep) who said that the towing service had tried to call her to verify that she still needed help but that she didn't answer and her voicemail was full. My daughter is a phone savant - there were no missed calls, and her voicemail is completely empty, so that didn't happen. It also doesn't explain the late-night no-show. It infuriates me to think my daughter could have been stuck on the side of the road with a flat waiting for AAA for hours on end. It was pure dumb luck that the flat happened in a safe spot where she could spend the night.Like insurance, AAA is something you pay for that you hope you never need.

I was informed by the person answering the phone that they do not get information on ETAs so she could not help.

At 920 I received notification that no one was going to be there at 937pm as expected……and not only that…..no ETA was provided.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED AAA BACK TO GET AN EXPLANATION.  I was informed by the person answering the phone that they do not get information on ETAs so she could not help.  I asked to speak to a supervisor…..none was available….SURPRIZE!!!!.  I have paid this company for all these years and the time when you truly need them…..all you get is a run around.  AAA is a pitiful excuse for “emergency roadside assistance”  When they leave someone stranded for hours in the dark with no hope of help in sight.  I am cancelling my membership tomorrow.  Most of my extended family are aware of this situation as they have been on the phone with me……and they will be cancelling as well.

A++ As I read these other reviews, I see a lot of disgruntled consumers, but even the consumer has to ask themselves, how was your attitude when calling in. If the area you are in has very few tow companies associated with Triple AAA that could be the issue, and did you know that if CHP or local law enforcement request a tow truck or several those calls take precedence no matter what your place is in the que, and the operator taking your info to dispatch has no way of knowing this.

The damages weren’t too bad but it still requires my car to be in the shop for almost 2 weeks. I took my car to get an estimate the end of June and almost 3 weeks went by before I called the repair shop to see what the deal was. They notifies me for the past almost 3 weeks they had been trying to get ahold of a AAA employee to have paperwork sent over to start my claim and estimate on the car. I had to call the lady that hit me and have her pass on her personal agent number so they could finally get that started. They also told me AAA would be covering a rental which you think would be the least they could do as how I didn’t ask for their client to hit my car and I have a life but no they gave me $138 for loss of courtesy and I have to come outta pocket $600 dollars for a rental that doesn’t even cover the whole time my car is in the shop. How am I to get to work and to handle my responsibilities and priorities when your client inconvenienced me and I’m suppose to pay make it make sense. Then the clients agent left several voicemails for her to never call back you guys are failing at handling this situation properly and respectfully. I’ve even considered legal actions due to the mental and emotional toll this is taking on my physical well being. The amount of stress and your client hit my car almost 2 months ago and stuff is still not being resolved. You guys are awful and should be ashamed of your business. The most distasteful part of the whole situation is your employees saying “ well you don’t have to get a rental” and “ if you have an extra car just use that”.

358,"Stranded on Turnpike for SEVEN HOURS - NEVER AGAIN AAAAugust 19th I was stranded on turnpike 91 between Oakland and Winter Garden.  Called AAA at 12:15pm and was in the same location until 7:00pm (7 HOURS!!) and NEVER received a tow and they simply DID NOT care. Two NO customer service representees put me back in que on hold for over 20 mins each time.  All while explaining my cell battery was quickly dying with only 20% remaining. The last male rep who was supposedly a supervisor (Ryan) did the same thing put me back in que. After that rep another supposed supervisor told me a tow truck would be arriving within 1-1.5 hrs and the drivers name was Darryl. That driver NEVER showed up and when a rep called me about 45 mins later she explained the system had no notes of a Darryl or that a rep even spoke with me meaning he did not notate the account, he just made something up to appease me and get me off his line.  The lack of customer service and accountability is beyond horrible for any in an emergency situation. In 2021 there were 1100 deaths due to emergency related cars stranded on the side of a road or freeway. I called a private company and within 30 mins they arrived, they also charged me $350 for a tow 12 miles from where I was stranded. Once I was home a rep had left a message sometime between 7-8pm explaining they had finally found a driver that would do a pick up but it would be closer to 10pm before he could get there. Executives of AAA;David Polansky, Kathleen F. Bower, Paul Twidale, Margaret Diego Pittelkow, Jason Hosaflook, Scott Parker, Douglas Kelly, and Judd Williams all executive officers of AAA are accountable in various degrees of course but still accountable for a company that pretends to be in the business of helping people find safety when stranded on our public highways and roads. One of the excuses that was given by several of the reps including supervisors was that the third party tow companies could choose to deny a pick-up depending on the circumstances/location of the service call or I guess much simpler to just say depending on if they wanted to work at that moment the request came in. AAA your system is beyond BROKEN and you should be accountable and in the tragic event a life is injured or lost. I hope that stranded individuals will call Morgan and Morgan and sues you until you have to go out of business at least your pretend roadside assistance division. You have no place in our great country to play with people's lives and pretend you offer help when they're in dire straits. Secondly, please train your customer service representees better. Require/demand notes be left for each call that the associate receives. No one should EVER be placed back in a que to hold for another rep to simply have to explain the entire situation over, train them on empathy, compassion and ACCOUNTABILITY. I in my 20's was in customer service for five years and as someone that exceled and received accolades for taking more time, listening to their concerns and not pushing them OFF on another rep just because you don't want to work that hard or can't handle people that are stressed and begging for HELP. IT IS YOUR JOB to help and if you can't do that find a job more fitting as customer service will always always come with upset customers. To the supposed male supervisor ""Ryan"" please get out of customer service, you have no place in a field that requires listening without being so sensitive that your own needs or emotions take precedent over your job. Your callers are looking for HELP, you failed me and AAA on July 19th, I'm certain I was not the first nor will I be the last. NEVER AGAIN AAA",1,0.088,0.828,0.084,0.7312

She became increasingly combative and when I requested a supervisor she refused to send me to one and the call was magically released. I called back spoke with an Alicia and she put me through to a person who was supposed to be a supervisor but behaved much like this Judy. His name is Orlando agent id is 37427. He immediately began trying to tell me why I didnt know what I was talking about and had used all of my service calls. He said he didnt even know how to use his own companys app to direct me where the service calls dates and details were listed but claimed he knew all about them.  Multiple times I requested this info as he basically called me a liar. Eventually I requested an email of the details since he could not tell me anything about where he was pulling this info. Initially, he acted as if he was going to send me at least an email but then refused. He too was rude and combative- i stated i was not simply going to take his word for it, he certainly was not me. He only wanted to ram the info ONLY he could see into the conversation refusing to provide ANY proof. I was considering getting life insurance and other products through TRIPLE AAA.

We have the gold membership and pay a LOT of money for this due to the BENEFIT of the greater towing distance.

It had a screw stuck in the tire. I immediately called AAA. At first, I was told I would be listed as a ""priority"" but a few minutes later, I was called back and the rep said the soonest someone could get to me would be at 3am. I shouted: ""3am!... that's 3 hours waiting for help!"" I was in a dark parking lot with nobody around to assist me. However, I calmed down and apologized to the rep, because she was so kind & sympathetic. I told her it wasn't her fault her employer (AAA) has been cutting corners, and lying about the great service they will provide for their stranded drivers. She said they had very few tow companies ""under contract"" in my area. ""Really?!!, In a large area like Tampa Bay / St Pete area?...Unbelievable!"" She had called several companies, and the only guy, who would agree to assist me would be driving all the way up from Sarasota. So, I took a deep breath, and stuck it out. However, it ended up being a 4 hour wait instead of a 3 hour wait. He arrived at 4am. Nice guy, quickly changed my tire and said he was ""sorry for the delay.""

The fact you only cover 7 miles and not inform your customers that is the case is crazy. You can’t use your spouses services unless the are with you. The company has really gone downhill and the service is bad. Call around for a tow please don’t purchase any type of policy from AAA. The other companies will be way cheaper trust. If I was told I had to pay for any miles after the 7 mile mark. I would have declined to accept the service. I wasn’t told this until I called and complained.

Clearly their elitist viewpoint of their snide self worth, allows them to occasional throw nutritious bread crumbs to a select few drivers in dire roadside emergencies.

All the mechanics in my area are busy so the soonest I could get an appointment was 2 weeks in the future. This residential driveway is not mine. My drive way is blocking in the homeowners car. I just needed to get my car pulled out of their driveway and put on the street where it could stay until my appointment with a mechanic and not be blocking anyone in. After calling AAA they informed me that my new van is not covered by my current coverage so I would have to buy RV coverage and upgrade. So i paid to upgrade. After taking my payment the agent told me that i actually would NOT be able to use my coverage that day because there was a 5 day waiting period. I was annoyed because they never informed me of that before I paid for the upgrade. I was able to convince the homeowner to let me keep my van in their driveway until the 5 day waiting period was over. Did i mention that their house is located 2 hours away from where i live? so I drove 2 hours home in another car. then 5 days later drove 2 hours back, called AAA again only to be informed that they wouldn't tow my car out of the driveway because it is at a residential residence and considered a ""relocation"" tow because it isn't blocking anything. I told them the exact situation last week when they sold me on the upgrade, but they never once mentioned that even after I paid for the upgrade they still wouldn't be able to tow my vehicle.  The vehicle is blocking someone else's car that is not mine and it is in a residence that is not mine but they won't move it because its not on the side of a road.

By 1 am they told me they all of a sudden had no driver available! I said you told me one was on the way!! Well.. no driver came and AAA told me to leave my keys on the floor with my truck unlocked for an absent pickup. No way!!!!! I was in an inner city at a nasty gas station. Then they suggested i call a tow truck on my own to pay out of picket and i could get reimbursed. I called that same tow company that AAA has a contract with… Interstate towing and guess what?? Suddenly they have a driver to come get me in 30 min. for 1200.00 dollars!!! Thats extorting the customer!! The same tow company can’t get me because they “have no drivers available” but they do have drivers all of a sudden when they can make more money off the person in distress? Nah… thats bad business and i now have a case pending. No driver available means the tow company doesn’t feel like going out on the road unless it’s financially worth it.

I called again two hours later, following those two hours a tow truck driver showed up, he was wonderful! The only problem was,  my car, which is a Mercedes was stuck in park and it wouldn't go into neutral so he could tow my vehicle. He told me he called in for a tow truck that could tow it. Of course he had to do it through AAA. 2 hours later I didn't hear from anybody. I called, they said they'd send somebody. It is now 3:10 in the afternoon nobody has picked up my vehicle. I called again she said we'll have somebody come out and get it. AAA you are the biggest disappointment of any company that I've dealt with since I've lived in Florida.

However, when we did use the services that we duly paid for, it seems to have led to the non-renewal of our policy. This approach by AAA feels not only inconsiderate but also unjust.It's disheartening to realize that a company I trusted for so long would not provide any clarification for their decision, especially considering the fact that there was no apparent reason for this action.In conclusion, this experience has left a sour taste, and I believe AAA's policy, in this case, is highly unsatisfactory and lacks transparency.",1,0.038,0.892,0.07,0.5351

497,"A review for AAA Auto ServicesA review for AAA Auto Services - Vernon Hills, IL I dropped off my car for an oil change (2013 Subaru Outback, 75,000 miles). The service took about an hour as suggested.  When I picked it up, several of my dash lights illuminated within 2 or 3 miles of my departure suggesting engine, brake, and cruise control problems .  I called AAA and the manager came out and checked the gas cap and the air filter.  Gas cap was tight but there was a dirty 'cabin filter' in the engine air filter canister.  Seemed odd to me because I checked the air filter 2 weeks earlier and the correct one was installed and it was clean. The incorrect filter caused a vacuum leak due to improper sealing in the filter box likely causing the problem.  AAA said they had a replacement air filter in stock for $38 which seemed a bit excessive so I went to the Walmart down the street and bought one for $12.88.  It took about 5 minutes to install.BOTTOM LINE . . . when my car went in for the oil change it was running fine. We've never had a problem with it and have maintained it according to mfg recommendations.  After the oil change it was riddled with sudden problems.  Also . . . AAA had suggested I needed an immediate front brake replacement for about $600.  When I took it into Subaru the next day to correct the problems that existed right after the oil change (at a cost of ~$200) Subaru also checked the brakes and mentioned that there was 25-30% of the front pads remaining which should last me another 8-10K miles.  A little research in the internet indicated that a front brake job (pads and routers) should cost about $400 (KBB reference).

However, we didn’t make the appointment because we got a flat tire just down the street before we were to get on the Mass Pike in Newton, MA. How lucky we were that the flat didn’t happen on the turnpike and luckier still that his 96 year old mother wasn’t in the car. We canceled the doctor appointment and had AAA tow the car. The lug nuts had been previously installed with a machine making them impossible to loosen. The young road service guy, Juan couldn’t have been nicer nor more professional. We determined that my car should be taken to my dealership. Juan drove my car onto his flatbed tow vehicle.

Tow truck # 1 shows up with a flatbed and by with my pickup on that truck would have been well over 7 feet high. So I call AAA again repeating my previous instructions and explaining that a flatbed had shown up. Ok they said they would take care of it and send a low profile tow vehicle. Tow truck # 2 shows up with a high profile tow truck and shows me on his phone that there were no special instructions concerning the low ceiling. I call AAA again and explain the situation again with specific reference to the main problem being the 7 foot ceiling, AAA says we will take care of it.Tow truck # 3 calls me the next morning to inform me that he is enroute and I ask him if he knows about the low profile requirement, he does not and can't do the tow. I call AAA again and someone has cancelled my request ???? So here I am 26 hours later, no tow, the repair shop closes in 2 hours and I get a text saying a new tow truck will be here in 164 minutes. The repair shop will be closed and I bet the tow truck that shows up will not be low profile.Here is my take on this company now. The operators you call are working from home in some location far from where I live. Every truck that has shown up is at least an hour away from where I live and there are plenty of tow companies closer. It isn't AAA anymore they were bought out and expecting good service in an emergency might leave you stranded. My case wasn't an emergency but it has we convinced that going forward I need to go to Good Sam or some other company.

I requested a tow service, and Elijah (Hadley tow truck) answered the call. Despite insisting that my car was not okay to drive home in due to it overheating and smoking from the hood, he continuously pushed me to drive it on the freeway to my home in the next city over. He did not refuse me a tow service, but kept urging me that it was okay to drive home. After getting him to tow my car, he did not confirm the address with me (nor my ID at the beginning of the meeting, for that matter), and took it to the wrong address. I told him that my house was a block away, but he told me to just drive it the block to the address I provided in the initial service call. Elijah also refused to take it to my house because ""he would have to make a U-turn."" I kept insisting he not take my car off of the tow-truck, but he continued to ignore my requests and left my car in front of some random person's house. He told me that because he got a wrong address from Triple A, he was not allowed to take it to the address I told him was mine. I learned on the phone with Triple A customer service after the fact that he made that rule up, and should have taken my house to the address I gave to Triple A (which was correct on my end). I asked for his name or his card, and seeing that I was upset, he told me that he didn't have a card, and that his name was ""Oowangabunga"" while waving his hands in the air.

As per all the former AAA calls I've made I knew that meant at least 2 or 3 hours, so I resigned myself to wait with the vehicle and my father and husband came out to meet me so I wouldn't be alone.

I waited over four miserable hours with my vehicle all for nothing when a cursory Google search (which I checked once I had more reliable service) said no tow trucks in the area ran after 7pm. I'm not going to pretend like I know how AAA runs it's business but if they only have a few contracts with local towing companies, why do they not also have a list of their hours as well?

647,Punished for using services I paid forAfter having AAA for 3 years they decided to downgrade me because I used their services I paid for 2 many time in the past 3 years. I pay for plus for 3 people per year. We use plus because it's 100 miles free towing. We live in the rural area. The year before yes. We had some issues with our big truck and had to town it like 3 times. But again. We have 3 people on our policy who get 100 miles time 4 a year. Then we had to use them again this year because my daughter broke down at college who is a card holder. So they are saying the 4 towing in 3 years is to much.  When I paid for a total of 12 towing per year that's 36 towing in the last 3 years I've had AAA. They want me to summit in writing why I think their decision should be changed. What is this elementary school. If I pay for a service I should be able to use that service without being punished. We will write them and we will not use them anymore. I'm super disappointed in their ways of business practice. I will be writing this review on every review place I can and social media.,2,0.059,0.868,0.073,0.4802

Today, on 3/8/23 I called again and got all the above excuses yet again, with her final comment being that I would be receiving a check by the end of this week.  I have been a member since 2012, have never needed or used their roadside services.  I believe they are deliberately trying to delay me for 60 days because that is the time frame for disputing the credit card charge.  I will definitely be going to my bank before the 60 day deadline.

They gave me a hard time replacing it and now It is dead again and still under warranty. They came out after missing a day's work telling me I don't have the proper documents after testing the battery and telling me it's toasted and it is no good. A neighbor came over and Pete's technician removed the battery placed it on the ground while on the phone and moved out of the road so a neighbor can get by. The technician said you moved the battery now we are not definitely going to replace it and left. I had my documents showing the battery is under warranty and even showed him the text from AAA date of call confirmation code. I had to call AAA back to reschedule another vendor had them confirm with another confirmation number that was text at 2:13 pm. Yesterday. Ok called AAA every 2 hours and the AAA rep kept saying they are in rout and told me it was national battery coming out.  I am still waiting finally at 9 pm. The last call to them. They said they never dispatched it to them. They are the only ones they can dispatch t is Pete's. They do not have a National vendor and they are closed now.

810,"AAA Auto Club Bait and Switch False AdertisingAAA Auto ClubDecember 30-2022 I inquired with spokesperson at AAA membership about their plans.  The base is “Classic” with 5 miles free towing and $5.00 per mile after that.  According to the AAA  spokesperson the next plan is “Plus” which gives 100 miles free towing 4 times a year.  The proposition was if I added on another person I and the other person would have 5 trips a year.   The spokesperson advertised that during the 1st 24 hours if  towing is used then the charge would be an extra $65.00.  After the first 24 hours I was clear to utilized the 100 miles free towing.  This information is what I based my decision on to buy AAA from their competitor.  The AAA spokesperson sent an email, verify my membership in the “Plus” plan.  Nothing more than the number and card expectation in 7 days.  When I utilized the membership for towing on 1-2-23 , 3 days later, AAA  emergency towing, would not honor my upgraded “Plus” plan I paid for and charged me $5.00 a mile after the first 5 miles.  I had many conversations with AAA over the Bait and Switch routine and the False Advertisement.  I later required another toll as I was broken down on the road.  AAA emergency services said Modz Towing would arrive in 20 minutes.  45 minutes later AAA Emergency Services recalled me as I sat on the road and told me to call the police so they could re route traffic around me and she put me next for Modz Towing to pick up since I was in the street.  Modz called as I was on the call with AAA and said AAA doesn’t know what is going on as they are sitting in New Jersey and I was number 8, they would pick be up in another 3 hours while I sat on the road.  Ultimately after sitting in the street for 3 hours my vehicle arrived at the destination without “ 3 hours AAA Emergency” service.  On 1-3-23 at 7:50pm I recalled AAA recorded the call and spoke with “Trinity” in membership.  I asked about my membership, Trinity praised me for having the “Plus” plan.  (In very detail I made Trinity explained the benefits I could now use.)  I asked Trinity at AAA specifically if I had to pay after the first 5 miles. “5 TIMES, get that ,5 TIMES”  Trinity at AAA , CLEARLY AND EMPHATICALLY swore  that I currently , that day, had 100 miles free towing and there was not a 7 day wait period.  Trinity said I was past the 24 hours fee.  The next morning on 1-4-23 again I called AAA and spoke with Erica with AAA emergency towing.  Again Erica charged me $5.00 a mile after the first 5 miles.  Erica wanted to know if I was safe and I told her with AAA it doesn’t matter if you are safe as the service does not get there any faster even you sit on the street for 3 hours.  It is not a feeling about AAA service, IT IS A FACT!!!! That if you are in danger sitting on the road or sitting in your living room the tow truck will get there according to their own schedule.  AAA asking if you are in a safe location is just creating a false sense of urgency on on your behalf which is only AAA’s benefit, which is a lie.  The tow trucks get to you when they want to.  They DO NOT work for AAA and follow their own schedule.  After my cdonverstion with AAA membership Trinity on 1-3-23 7:50 I again arranged a tow on 1-4-23 overpaying for my membership level again.

At 7:30 I called and after the representative talked to dispatch, told that they are having trouble finding a provider and they would keep working on it and if I found a towing company in the meantime that I could file for a reimbursement.

So if you live in a city that spread out like Phoenix it's hardly worth it. I have a lifetime membership through an insurance policy but now for the last 5 years I've had to add the plus membership to get a 100 miles for towing, That now brings the annual cost to over a $100 for someone who doesn't have a lifetime membership. And since they stop sub contracting the tow services and automated the service call center its awful, last tow truck took 4 hrs, except in 2020  When there was hardly anyone on the road it took 30 minutes.

The first time I was told someone was coming within an hour - called back after an hour and a half and was told it would be an additional 45 minutes, still after no updates I called again and was told the driver would call me shortly. He did and told me that he wasn’t a tow truck driver and I had requested a tow - called AAA back and they said they didn’t know I needed a tow truck…. Which I clearly requested on their app and over the phone when I was following up. I was then told “ oh, don’t use the app to request a tow just call us for that in the future … the app tends to glitch” …….then yet another hour later I called for an update and was told my call was cancelled…. And they “ were not sure why” - eventually after waiting for 6 hours in a parking lot someone arrived and insisted on trying to jump start my car even though I made it clear it would not work and at this point I just wanted my car to be taken to a mechanic - but he refused to listen and after about another half hour of him trying to jump the car - he finally said “ looks like we will need to tow it …” ….. I went through another run around last night. The first rep was pleasant and told me it would be a little over an hour before assistance arrived, but the driver would call when he was on his way. After an hour I called for an update I was informed it would be another hour on top of the normal wait time - when I asked if the driver would still call when he was on his way because I was getting concerned because it was almost midnight and I was in an almost empty parking lot - I was told “ I can’t guarantee  he will call you first- you just have to wait “. Another hour passes with no communication and I call again and was asked for an update because at this point I had no idea when this tow truck would come and I had called for ride in case they were not getting close . The rep told me “ I don’t know why they gave you time estimates - they aren’t supposed to do that “…….I have never called their service and not been given a time estimate ….though they seem to be wrong every time but this is the first that ever told me “ I can’t give you an estimated arrival time “ At this point it’s the middle of the night in an abandoned parking lot and even though I didn’t want to leave my car for the rest of the night and loose all of my “ progress” of  sitting and waiting I elected to get ride home from my family member. It was only then I was told “ if you leave your car unlocked and put the key in it - the tow driver can still pick it up” - please keep in mind this option was never given to me before this moment….I told her even though my car won’t start I don’t feel comfortable leaving my car unlocked because there are valuable things in the car that my ride cannot transport right now and to cancel the service request and I would try my “ luck “ with them tomorrow as it is easier to feel safe in my car when it isn’t after 1am in an abandoned parking lot” ….. hopefully I can get a tow today through another source…..and to top it all off …..one hour after I arrived home….

I have been a member for years like most people and trusted them when my vehicle has broken down or I needed an emergency.  Well I had a battery that was dead and called AAA to get someone out to help- had their own AAA guy come out and sell me a AAA brand battery ( which I was already skeptical about ). The guy assured me that it was good and would as good as my previous battery brand.  Exactly 41 days later I was a half mile off a freeway on a forest road ( yes I know now Aaa doesn’t do anything that’s not on a real road ).  The problem was that it was Nov 22 in a cold climate and my battery was dead so I called AAA. Submitted a request and was given the text message that says a driver will be coming your way in 90 min.  I waited and after the time, my ride was cancelled.  I submitted another request and got the same message.  After 40 min since my second request I was contacted by AAA and cut short when the agent transferred me to the actually tow company.  She was rude and told me they wouldn’t take their expensive trucks down a forest road which I explained a Chevy volt just drove by. ( it’s a 2 wheel electric car that has tiny clearance. ).  I asked if I could walk my battery out to the highway to get a new one and they said the battery has to be with the truck and they couldn’t do anything.  So I’ve wasted multiple hours being stuck in 34 degree weather. I finally get a company that will come out ( which is why I am now a member of GOODSAM now, there service is way better and they actually go off-road to help people in need ).  When the company came out they tested my battery and said it was a bad battery with a bad cell.   When he said this, I called AAA and told them what was going on and the gentleman on the phone explained how I could get a reimbursement for the bad battery.  So I towed my truck to a town 20+ miles away now it’s been 6+ hours and went to a auto one and bought a new battery. This is where today came into play and why I’m writing the review.  After submitting the receipts and filling out the paperwork, I received a call from their claim department saying I’m out of luck and they won’t help.  They say I should have called AAA when I got towed to auto zone and waited another 90+ minutes to have them bring another bad battery.   I explained how everything happened and the man just kept saying it’s your fault you bought a new battery and wouldn’t take any responsibility for a bad AAA brand battery less than 2 months of having it.  I tried to ask for a supervisor and was told he would transfer me to the legal department.    I do want to thank the gentleman at AAA because I won’t ever make the mistake of doing business with a company like this and their horrible service.  Their wait times and actual care for people are horrific and I’m more than happy to not spend my money and to let everyone I know how they treat people.

My vehicle broke down in the city in the middle of a busy intersection & it had to be immediately towed from the scene, because it was blocking traffic. The police had a local business tow it to their garage nearby. I called AAA to have it towed from the garage to my residence & it took them about 8 hours just to do this!!! The vehicle was no more than an hour from my home at the time. I had to speak to about 4/5 different people over the phone & was originally told I had to be present for the driver of the tow truck, despite my explanation of having needed a ride & no longer being in the area where my car was. The first individual whom I spoke with didn't give me the unattended tow option, in fact told me the complete opposite, that I must stay with my vehicle. They are extremely slow at assisting customers & horrible customer service on the phone also. Always says high call volume. They repeatedly asked me the same questions, even after I told them that I couldn't provide my plate # because I wasn't with the vehicle. They also continued to ask whether I paid the tow fee, which I had. Then once the tow truck came, the driver had problems with getting my car off the flatbed.

They had told him it would be roughly 30 mins, but it was more like 4 hours. For me, they estimated 75 mins, but was 8 hours. Completely unacceptable. They're supposed to help customers, not leave them stranded. Both mine & my friend's experiences were very recent & happened when it was freezing cold out too. I had AAA years ago & they were much better, more efficient & faster service. Now it's nothing but a 3 ring circus. I should add another customer service rep contacted me offering the unattended tow option, hours after I had already confirmed this with AAA!!!

This all began back in March of 2022, I was in my car and the timing belt broke, I called AAA for help and they told me my account was not active anymore and I had let it lapse, my bad. So I told them I wanted to reactivate my account and I paid the money to do so, after I paid they told me I would need to wait 48 hours before the account would be activated. So there I am in a broke down car and just paid to get my account up and going and now I had to wait 2 days. I had no choice but to wait and pushed my car to gas station and was lucky enough the owner was there and agreed to let me leave my car there until I could get it towed.  So 48 hours pass I call, I have it towed. End of that part of the story. Now today Nov-15-22 I was out on a hike and get back to my car and it would not start, the battery was dead and I was not close to anything or anyone and I though no big deal I will just call AAA, wrong, they told me that I didn’t have an active account and I told them I did and I used them back in match and that’s when I reactivated my account and had to wait 48 hours and used them, they told me it was not my account that was activated it was my 82 year old mothers account who has not drove a car in years account that was reactivated, I told them that she paid for it because she pays for both my sister and i to have roadside services and it’s just something she has always done for us, regardless, I told them that she did pay for the service but it was for me and that she does not drive anymore, they would not even listen to me and pretty much told me I was lying to them and I even asked if it was not my account that was reactivated then why did they end up towing my car back in match? The senior supervisor Eric and Mark and Nikki told me they should not have helped me then, I was blown away and I don’t understand why they can’t just admit there was a mistake, they have not ever once even talked to my mother, I have called and requested the service every time and they towed my car in march and why now is it that I don’t have an account and I did then?

943,"A Simple Service Results in DAMAGESBrief: I contacted AAA to determine why I had sensors showing on my car dash. AAA gave this service request to Pro-Star. A simple “wrong battery size” has resulted in a broken car door and me having to take time off of work for quotes and repairs.Long version:TI noticed several warning lights on my dash on my drive to work. During my noon break, I contacted AAA to put a sensor on the battery to determine the codes for the lights. I needed to determine if the car was safe to drive to the mechanic on the weekend or if I needed to have it towed. AAA gave the service request to Pro-Star. During this break, I got gas (my car door was fine) and met the Pro-Star service person back at my office. He arrived at about 12:22pm. When he arrived I explained the reason for the call (put the scanner on the battery and explain why the sensor were on). Knowing it would take a few minutes to scan the VIN, apply the sensor, and wait for the reading, I decided to grab a pre-made sandwich from a lunch truck a few yards away. I told the Pro-Star service person of my plans and told him I’d be right back. I was there for 5 minutes and barely paid for my items, I was 1st in line, and I see the Pro-Star person driving towards me. He handed me my keys out his window and told me there were no lights on my car and that the battery was fine and fully charged. I explained to him, again, the reason for the call and that there were, at least 5 lights on. Of course, the battery was fine, I’d had “winter services” done the weekend before with a new battery, new tires, and an oil change. The Pro-Star person would not return to my car to look with me. Feeling weird about the interaction and my unresolved issues, I return to my car and see my car door handle gapped open. I try to open my car door and it wouldn’t open. The handle was loose and not engaging anything to open itself. I immediately called the Pro-Star person back and even called their company; no answer (and no returned call since). My car door was broken by the Pro-Star service person. I contacted AAA about the broken door handle and the original issue. AAA gave me a claim form. I have to include quotes for repair for AAA to determine if they’ll approve my claim. AAA would not send its own claim team out. I must take time off to find a body shop and request a quote. Diagnostic costs me money directly and taking time off, even on a weekend, costs me (nobody is open on Sundays, my only day off). This means I have to take off work because the car dealership and service department is only open M-F 8am-12pm for diagnostics. I work in healthcare for a hospital and have my own practice; this running around has thrown off and will throw off my business. I have to enter the passenger side and climb over to the driver's seat. The door won’t open from the inside or outside. I had the car towed home because of the battery. The tow truck driver couldn’t climb over to mount the vehicle and I essentially had to go with him, at 10 pm at night, to put my own car on and off the tow truck.I can’t just leave the door broken and wait for AAA to determine if they’re liable for damages. Not being able to utilize a driver-side door is VERY dangerous and it would appear AAA doesn’t care. I need to go through their red tape. Talk about insult to injury! This guy isn’t going to admit to breaking my door. He closed my door, locked it, and probably pulled entirely to hard on the handle to make sure it was locked (I’m assuming here). My co-workers, also taking a break in their cars, said NOBODY else touched my car, in the 5 minutes that he was there with it. They noted the speed of the service request too; it was quick.Side note- I asked AAA not to send the same company out to determine the “lights on the dash” issue and they did anyway. The second Pro-Star service person, very nice guy, was willing to hear what his colleague had done and shared the number for their corporate office (still no returned call). He saw the lights (I was beginning to think I was in the Twilight Zone…there ARE lights there!). He also immediately assessed that the battery, although new, was completely wrong for my car.",1,0.065,0.905,0.031,-0.9784

My husband’s truck, a, 2000 F250 Ford Diesel was traveling  westbound on I-10 in Florida.  The truck was pulling a Coachman Classic Travel trailer following me.  We were traveling to our destination in Louisiana.  As I went through Tallahassee, and was at Exit 194, I noted that he was not behind me.  Moments later he called with trouble with the truck that had quit running. I went to the next exit and found him at the side of the road at mile marker 196 westbound on I-10.  I pulled in behind him and then walked to the front of his truck.  I noted a large engine oil slick that was in front of and under his truck.  Engine oil had leaked out of the truck.  He got his AAA card out (platinum RV plan card) and phone AAA for road service for the truck and travel trailer.  And no towing service could be found.  The service was to tow both the truck and the travel trailer back to our residence, 91 miles away.   Per the texts were received on my phone, there was road service towing help on the way.  But that never happened..  AAA kept on calling my phone, rather than his.  Then we found out that towing providers that are AAA providers network were refusing  to service the calls.  AAA kept on calling the wrong phone number, I was driving  instead of calling my husbands’ number at the roadside.   Where he was at on the side of the interstate.  After 6 hours, we started calling the Florida Highway Patrol.  Whom gave us a list of towing companies. After many unsuccessful calls to secure a towing service.  We found out that AAA had changed their coverage. Instead of 150 miles towing. AAA reimburses up to 500 dollars for towing.  We decided to take my truck 100 miles back and then come back to pick up the travel trailer and travel 100 miles back home.  Then have the truck towed to our residence in order to have time to go to the repair shop.  Calls to AAA were frustratingly long and un-resolved.  MY husband has been waiting on the side of the interstate for 10 hours by this time.  We did NOT want to leave the vehicle un-attended.  This is totally unacceptable.

No service provider showed up and there were not further updates from AAA and I never received any texts from the service provider. At 2:17PM I tried to reach AAA on their 800 number for status. Waited over 20 minutes and no one picked up. Finally I called a local locksmith who quickly sent someone out in 10 minutes. I had to pay $128 to get my car opened up. AAA roadside used to be reliable but no more!,1,0.065,0.898,0.037,-0.4897
