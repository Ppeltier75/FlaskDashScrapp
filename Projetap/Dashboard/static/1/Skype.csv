Now that my credit card account had been debited multiple times, I decided to cancel all Skype services immediately. So I haven't been a Skype customer for weeks, I deleted my Skype account and expressed my criticism. But: Although I have canceled all services, attempts are still being made to withdraw money for subscriptions that are supposed to be expiring. The emails that you receive from Skype indicate that you should hurry up with the payment in order to be able to continue using the allegedly (in fact no longer) existing services. If many of my fellow men were to claim that Skype is a criminal and fraud company, I would in fact have no counter-argument. These methods are absolutely dubious and beyond the line of fraud and theft. It is also significant that no one from Skype responds to the reviews shown here. So my insight: stay away from Skype. I will never again cooperate with a Microsoft company, let alone buy something that brings Microsoft profit. Just bad and dishonest.GERMAN: Über geraume Zeit hatte ich mehrere Telefonnummern und Länderpaket von Skype gebucht. Die Servicequalität war akzeptabel, doch nicht wirklich gut. Nun, da man x-fach von meinem Kreditkartenkonto abgebucht hatte, habe ich mich dazu entschlossen, alle Skype-Services sofort zu stornieren. Seit Wochen bin ich also kein Skype-Kunde mehr, habe auch das Skype-Konto gelöscht und meine Kritik geäußert. Aber: Obgleich ich alle Services storniert habe, versucht man weiterhin, Geld für angeblich auslaufende Abonnements abzubuchen. Die e-Mails, welche man von Skype erhält, weisen darauf hin, dass man sich mit der Zahlung beeilen sollte, um die angeblich (tatsächlich längst nicht mehr) bestehenden Services weiter nutzen zu können. Sollten zahlreiche meiner Mitmenschen behaupten, Skype sei ein Verbrecher- und Betrügerunternehmen, so hätte ich in der Tat kein Gegenargument. Diese Methoden sind absolut unseriös und jenseits der Grenze zu Betrug und Diebstahl. Bezeichnend ist auch, dass niemand von Skype auf die hier gezeigten Kritiken eingeht. Meine Erkenntnis deshalb: Finger weg von Skype. Ich werde niemals mehr mit einem Microsoft-Unternehmen kooperieren, schon garnicht etwas kaufen, was Microsoft Profit bringt.

134,"I cannot recommend Skype to anyone for professional useI cannot recommend Skype to anyone if you need to use it professionally. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has a fairly consistent reasonable quality of sound and connection... But that you can get easily and anywhere nowadays.... And that is where the list of Skype-benefits stops. In many countries Skype (one of the first and biggest providers of online phone service in the world!) cannot issue local phone numbers. The number of countries where you can apply for a local Skype number are in fact very limited. Even in Europe they are scarse!...Then there's the invoices. Like many bigtech companies, Skype (Microsoft) is for some reason not able or willing to provide clients any kind of an invoice for their purchases. The number of countries where Skype can provide a VAT-invoice is -again- very limited. But why not -at least- provide clients with a downloadable pdf-invoice with the details that they can find online in their account??? How difficult can it be!???... For business purposes Skype is totally useless, unless maybe if you live in one of those few countries where they do provide the full service. However, in that case you still have to suffer from Skype's horrible client service. Then there's of course the question whether one should use Skype for private communication. Well, you could (I sometimes do, if it is unavoidable) However, there's enough reason not to do so. Foremost, there is the privacy issues. Skype will collect your data and use it for God knows what. In fact, you're better off using messengers like Wickr (especially for professional use) Signal or (less safe) Telegram. These messengers don't provide phone numbers unfortunately, but they do allow you to make voice and some even video calls too. Look into it... Finally, my advice when it comes to using voip: there's lots of really good, specialized providers of voip-services nowadays (offering phone numbers and many more features like call recording for example). Look around and you'll find one that you like. My experience is that the smaller ones often give the best service at the best conditions. Just stay away from Skype!... You'll save yourself lots of headache...",1,0.071,0.798,0.13,0.9781

144,"Skype is a widely reco""Skype: Pioneering Digital Communication Through Voice and Video""gnized…Skype is a widely recognized telecommunications application that allows users to make voice and video calls, as well as send instant messages and files over the internet. While I don't have personal experiences, I can provide information up until September 2021.Skype was one of the pioneers in the realm of internet-based communication, offering free or low-cost voice and video calls to other Skype users around the world. It was known for its user-friendly interface, cross-platform compatibility, and the ability to connect with both individuals and groups. Skype also allowed users to make calls to traditional landlines and mobile phones for a fee, making it a versatile communication tool.One of Skype's standout features was its video call functionality, which played a significant role in keeping people connected across long distances. It was particularly useful for maintaining personal and professional relationships, especially when physical meetings were not possible.Skype also offered text messaging, file sharing, and screen sharing capabilities, enhancing its utility for collaboration and remote work. However, over time, competition from other platforms like WhatsApp, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet led to changes in the way people communicate digitally.In recent years, Microsoft, the parent company of Skype, has integrated some of Skype's functionalities into its other products, like Microsoft Teams. This has led to a shift in focus for Skype towards a more business-oriented audience.Despite its historical significance, Skype has seen a decline in usage compared to newer and more specialized communication tools. It remains a part of digital communication history as one of the first applications to truly popularize online video calling and instant messaging.",3,0.0,0.884,0.116,0.9817

154,"I have been using Skype for over 30…I have been using Skype for over 30 years. Since I live in Norway. While my parents and sister live in Bulgaria. And have been very happy with Skype. Until Skype became part of Microsoft.My mother in Bulgaria got sick a few months ago. And she finds herself somewhere without a landline. Therefore she has to use only her old-fashioned mobile phone. Without internet and the option to download the APP is.Therefore, I would continue to use Skype to keep in touch with her. 3 months ago I extended my Skype subscription so that it will apply to mobile phones in addition to landlines. And I pay about €15 a month for this subscription.In addition to this subscription, I also have 60 minutes of free calls. Since I have an yearly Ofis subscription with Microsoft. But it doesn't help anything. Every time I call my mom, Skype tells me to pay and pay. Because Skype doesn't use the subscriptions I have. But instead I am charged for calls per minute, which is much more expensive.Today I tried to get help from Skype to solve this problem. Because I have felt cheated by this company. There was no help phone to be found. After many automatic questions and answers. Then I ended up on a page where they promised chat help. And I had to stand in a long line. I was number 66 in the line.It is not enough that you have to wait for them to help 66 people before me. But it said that you must not close this window. Because then you could get out of the line. In other words. You had to block your phone while waiting in line.And I waited, and waited, and waited. After about 2 hours I was number 1 in the line. Then I thought I would soon get the help I needed. But no. Another 2 hours passed while I was number 1 in the line. Without anything happening. Then I gave up.It seemed that people from Microsoft are speculating that if you choose to block your mobile to wait several hours for help. Most will give up. Since many people depend on using their mobiles for various tasks in everyday life.Many simple Norwegian companies that do not deal with software technology use software that give you the choice of being called or contacted back if there are long lines for help. But Microsoft probably don't have access to such ""complicated"" technology. Ha ha.  Maybe Mr. Bill Gates should try to fix the problems in his own company first.

158,"Microsoft Ruined Skype - Hemorrhaging SubsSkype’s annual revenues have fallen -74.5% since Microsoft’s 2011 $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype…Something’s obviously very wrong here.Microsoft has piled on ridiculously conspicuous Skype accounting practices, inconsistent billing, poor communication, connectivity (dropped calls on pickup, etc…), leading ultimately to client dissatisfaction, frustration, cancellations, churn, lost subs, lost revenue…(eg:) When required to replace / update your (dead) card on file, including annual subscriptions, MS won’t let you delete the original card, even after the charge, even after a replacement card has been posted; they’ll simply inform you, if you do so, they’ll cancel your subscription; all this due to their knowingly, creepy, buggy practices, software…Curiously, they allow stacked multiple cards, but MS will only bill the original card, which will eventually expire and/or is compromised, and fails; they won’t use the new card on file, exasperating annual subscriptions.Skype and SkypeIn are billed separately, in different locals, at differing times; no one could guide me to my SkypeIn pay details today… So, not only do you have to deal with Skype, SkypeIn, you submit payment through separate MS gateways, dealing with different portals, within MS… Again, a ridiculously ludicrously ineffectual interface, awful coding… Who’s actually in charge of creating this utter monstrosity, and why break something that wasn’t already broken…? How many more assets will MS endlessly pour into Skype; have they learned nothing from their past?Furthermore, instead of maintaining established payments through Skype, you’re redirected to a myriad of meaningless, confusing, non-navigational, non-intuitive MS interfaces, which resulted in an expired certificate.You’re only notified, less than a moments notice, your subscription has been CANCELLED, less than 48 hours prior to the subscription’s actual expiration, but within this timeframe, the account magically remains active, throwing users into a panicked state, even though a replacement card had already been on file, for almost 2 months prior, but MS elected not to use it; are they intentionally trying to sabotage themselves?As a legacy client, since Skype’s inception, I spent close to 6 hours, continuously as a MS hostage today, on their so-called chat support (no, you can’t speak with a human, only exhaustive chat text), as I was passed around like a rag doll, through ~10 different chat CSRs, as no one had the skill sets to resolve my matter, which they ultimately admitted they weren’t able to resolve, escalating upwards, meanwhile my Skype and SkypeIn will stop functioning until they fix the issue.This is a known issue which has been in existence since MS Skype acquisition, something which the FCC/SEC perhaps should investigate.How can a company of Microsoft’s stature, allow an acquired $8.5 billion asset, such as Skype, only to run it off the rails, with their ineffectual user interface, using MS proprietary coding, which doesn’t provide the same user interface experience, on their own or other platforms, including Android, iOS, etc… due in part to inconsistent proprietary coding, seemingly non existent debugging?One doesn’t have the same user interface on differing platforms; When chat support directs you to do something, that feature isn’t there… A very egregious waste of people’s personal time, and they’re simply unwilling to offer any compensation.Notifying them of their pitfalls leads absolutely nowhere… Nothing changes.- You can only stack crap so high before it collapses…MS has decided to add to Skype, Bing, AI and a myriad of other totally worthless unrelated, cluttered, nonessential communications features to the app, so much so, it’s now no longer Skype, while at the same time, I personally believe it has significantly increased the apps overhead, bogging down your device, decreasing security, increasing battery usage, all the while, constantly phishing your personal data... And all of this under a paid subscription banner…I didn’t sign up for any of this… Therefore I cannot recommend MS Skype in its present form.- - -*Skype was created by Niklas Zennström, Janus Friis, and four Estonian developers, first released in August 2003.

In September 2009, Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion from eBay, valuing the business at $2.92 billion. In May 2011, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion and used it to replace their Windows Live Messenger.

Due to a really rubbish account-management website offered by skype, I was unable to switch my payment to a new card.I received an email saying it couldn't take the £22.50 I was due to pay, even though I'd done my best to get my new card attached to the subscription. I then had to buy again, at the new higher price of over £40.The online support person tried to instruct me how to do it right in future, but even his instructions first were completely wrong. The eventual way to do it was not at all clear, so it's unsuprising that I was unable to do it by myself. (I'm a regular computer user and good with websites/technology but still couldn't find it myself.)However, in the end Microsoft still refused to let me have the original price - the one it had emailed me about and that I've paid all this time - saying it has reviewed its subscription prices.I would have been fine if it had just wrote to me before the subscription renewal to say that it can't continue at the old prices. But it didn't. It tried to take payment at the original price and then, because it's website is a bit sucky, I ended up on the new price. I think I should be entitled to a refund and I'm surprised and disappointed that they didn't offer better customer service on this occasion.Unfortunately I am stuck with them though. Although there are ways to port skype landline numbers, their price for the landline number is simply too competitive - even at the higher price of £40ish per year.",2,0.094,0.806,0.099,-0.0399

""We evaluated your appeal and verified your account was properly closed for a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement.

One of my friends is elderly, lives in Germany, and does not own a computer or smart phone - only a home phone.  I started a subscription 10 years ago allowing me to call her for 60 minutes per month.  This subscription was to be automatically renewed year over year.  For ten years this worked beautifully.  In March 2020, during our Corona virus self quarantine, I checked in with my friend in Germany a number of times.  The calls frequently dropped and I called her back. I did not pay attention that I had used up my 60 minutes for the month.  When I attempted to call my house bound friend on April 1, my international subscription was cancelled.  After finally reaching a live person at Microsoft Customer Service, I was advised of alternative Skype subscription which is 8 times more expensive.  I explained the reason why I had overused my 60 minutes during March, but my account still showed I had a subscription.  I was advised that the old subscription would not be available to me until March 2021, if then!  This is the company policy!

251,"Skype is a disaster since MicrosoftSkype is a disaster since it was purchased by Microsoft. It is the year 2020, if people do not have the option to have separate skype accounts for: work, friends & job interviews or hobbies then they do not have the option either to participate in modern life. Microsoft has a responsibility here that goes beyond the corporate one. At my workplace we disregarded Skype as an option because it is not the safest way to communicate with clients. Politically speaking it is a mess that Microsoft is unwilling to treat users in a decent manner. The security questions are illegally forcing millions of users to provide Microsoft with information which they have no right to know (phone number, billing information, credit card information even if you didn't sign up with it etc.). And they are leaving European and American users no other choice than to use foreign services which will spy on them (as well) but use that to another country's advantage. Personally, (I am located in Germany) I haven't had access to any of my Skype accounts on any of my devices since 2015. I didn't sign up again for it either and I am using different services for work as well as privately. I am not going to give Microsoft my phone number and I will not use the service again. Even Whatsapp has the option for video calls and I consider it to be quite awkward when some businesses give a pass to Skype but use a ""freetime"" app like Whatsapp instead.

Exception is calls to United Arab Emirates. For that, to call from UK, i either pay the mobile charge of £3 per month to call using international-reduced-fees, which is £0.14pm for UAE, or I used to use skype-to-go. But recently Skype-to-go simply connects and call is silent and if you don't hang up it ""eats up"" all your credit. Or, in calls at few seconds into the call, all you hear is same recorded conversation of initial few seconds, a loop of repeating, replaying what you, or the other person said - in my experience, this bug used up 10min of credit even after i hung up. *BE very careful with skype with credit* as it can become much more expensive than using your normal line to call. One may say, it was a bug, not Skype's fault, Skype still paying the PSTN calls, but when the service is unsuitable and doesn't deliver the required quality to hold a consumer conversation, they should not be allowed to charge for it.

398,"Absolutely atrociousAbsolutely atrocious. Microsoft bought up a serious communication tool and replaced it with a social media app for kids. When I say ""replaced"", I mean replaced. Skype 8 isn't a new version of the same program, it's a new, crappy chat app that steals the Skype brand, and they've killed the original Skype we knew and loved.What makes it truly unusable for a purpose for which I've been using it for years is that I need to be able to access old chat history in an organized manner, but Microsoft has simultaneously taken away local storage, placed a time limit on the history, taken away the ability to ""jump back"" to earlier times, and made it impossible to copy more than a couple of screenfuls at a time. Also, small amount you can copy no longer comes out in an organized fashion with bracketed time/date stamps at the beginning of each message. The copied/pasted text doesn't show dates, and is messy and hard to read. At the same time they've taken this away, they've also taken away the ability to export chat history.So they've basically limited it to real time chat and SCREWED everyone who was relying on it for record keeping. Sure, we can find other programs, but we chose Skype because of the features that it had, and now we lose data continuity because of Microsoft's arrogance and callousness.There is absolutely no excuse for treating users like this. Microsoft clearly doesn't care how disruptive it is to people's lives to take away features by the boatload and force unnecessary changes down people's throats in programs that they RELY on. It's not ""an inconvenience"", as their reps patronizingly call it, it has a real impact on important aspects of people's lives. This is not only making me abandon Skype and convince other people to abandon it, it makes me mistrust Microsoft's brand by showing that they can't be relied on to maintain a consistent feature set and they bully their users.I didn't even need them to continue developing and improving Skype Classic, I just needed them to continue patching any new security issues and otherwise leave it the hell alone. Even that was apparently too much to ask!STAY AWAY FROM SKYPE AND AVOID MICROSOFT SOFTWARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!Now excuse me while I go and do something I should have done a long time ago...install Linux on my primary computer.

The bug was the Skype team, not the program!Then the updates came ... customers (non-IT) starting to call for support as they were lost in the 'enhanced' interface. Solution, uninstall and reinstall the Classic 7 version and, NEVER update!So far so good. Now, about 2 years later, some kids at MS developed a mobile targeted version, removing all great functionality Skype contained. Some manager must have found that this was a great idea, not to hurt their feelings I suppose, and MS decide to shove in our throats, whether we wanted or not. And now, we don't even have a choice anymore at all...Desktop Skype is ignored as if everyone is doing work on a smart phone or tablet! There are MILLIONS of Windows 10 and other PCs out there, used by people who do real work, and have real communications, all day long, every single day. And all that happened while MS is still claiming today they 'listened' to the users, yeah right...The new, young, brainless generation does not use Skype! But still, that is what MS aims for!Professionals, who build their communication with their customers around Skype are being totally ignored. Those are also the ONLY ones who actually did not mind paying for Skype Credit or get a personalized phone number.A lot of use are also losing business because of the way we communicated, customers switched and we do not always know to what if they don't tell us!So, thank you very much to the young generation, who just made sure they will NOT have a job anymore in a while, all for the sake of being 'modern' ...I fear Skype will just be left to die...

Hey, the interface does not even follow Microsoft's own guidelines for the equally ugly UWP system.

Things changed, and all for the worse. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Skype AKA Microsoft are doing this, to adult users:''You need a parent's permission.Based on your age, we need your parent's permission before you can use this account. Using a web browser, sign in to account.microsoft.com to get your parent's permission and come back to try again''.The heavy handed stupidity then means, as with me, the adult cannot access their account, even if they have money credit. So, one then has to open a Microsoft Account, simply to contact Microsoft, and then they either ask you to adopt the child, even though I am not a child, and in adopting and verifying, they ask for PAYMENT! Yes, the parent, guardian or simply the person trying to get their adult account back up and running, is supposed to give back details or CC card details, and pay 50 pence, just to allow the account to go back to how it was, before Microsoft's thug policing interfered! They only offer an alternative which is to put through an ID request, So, I sent them my driver's licence, scanned. Two weeks ago! All I got back was some impersonal, dim-wit Microsoft email, asking for the ID, again, as they claimed it was not attached! So, this was sent, I emailed from both private email and said awful, new Microsoft account and guess what? Nothing! So, here we are, almost three weeks down the line, and Microsoft doing what it does best, which is interfere and bully, and do nothing! PLUS they wanted money, up front, from an adult, as they accused me of being a minor. The thing is, they are doing this to all non Microsoft members of Skype, and it is so transparent, as they almost force you into creating a new account with them! This is nothing to do with the various adult platforms dealing with underage threats or misuse, this is Microsoft flexing it's bullying muscles again and if you don't play ball, they block accounts, and do not deal with issues!

750,"Skype is stealing money intentionally from its clientsSince Skype is taken over by Microsoft, Skype App became pathetic.But the major problem is that Microsoft is over billing the Skype customers secretly which I can now call intentional FRAUD. This does not happen just one time but many times. For example they continue to bill the cancelled subscription. When I started a chat they denied that subscription was cancelled and I had no proof because I never expected Skype to cheat me so I did not took the screenshot and it never emailed me any cancellation email so I asked the chat agent to now cancel it and write it down so that I have a proof by taking the screenshot of chat and he confirmed that now he has cancelled and it will not bill again but on next due date it got billed again and I contacted them again and they just gave lame excuses and still did not refund the extra billed money and said that due to some technical issue it was billed again. But technical issue was not my fault. It was set for 3 months billing and I can't keep checking every three months if they bill my card secretly or not as I make many purchases with my card. And it is not an excuse to bill me so much more for their system issues. I told them it was cheating and they just said that they can only apologize and refund is not in their control due to system problem.I have a many numbers purchased from Skype and I can not get rid of it now because those numbers are already given to many clients of ours. We have a Skype Manager account which was promised to get a priority support. But since Microsoft took over, it became a nightmare. Same thing happen again for a yearly number purchase and I got really angry and told them that they must refund the money because number was failed to be registered by their system and they still secretly billed my card so they said that they will refund it because I threaten to go public this time. The chat agent said the amount is refunded in Skype account but when I checked few dollars balance that was in Skype Credit was also gone instead getting my $30.00 back in Skype. So I told the chat agent that you guys are trying to make me fool but he said that he refunded it to my card and all amount will show on my card in few days. It is two months now but amount never showed in my card and if I am going to call them again they will give same lame excuses that not sure what happened. If I go for chargeback, they can cancel my remaining numbers giving the reason of the dispute. So now Skype is basically fraud and black mailer also. I have started a chat more than 20 minutes ago and still it is showing following wait message and I invest so much time in the issues that were already discussed and promised to be resolved after investing a lot of my time and effort:==We are experiencing higher than normal wait times.

813,"The average User Experience with SkypeWhen MSN Messenger was no longer an option, Skype was the best alternative. Since that point, the company really have become far too full of themselves. Bugs are plenty and updates to fix them are few. There are far more issues to condemn Skype than there are to praise it.Here are some frequent issues:1. Pending / Undelivered Text You can be typing away without issue when suddenly your messages are met with a spinning circle pending connection. At this moment, it's common to check if your internet is experiencing issues or perhaps the fault is with your partner (Whomever you're typing to). Commonly, I will send a message to someone else at this point to discover if the fault is on my end or on the other users end. Most, if not all times, I am met with the same issue, that messages sent to anyone from me are pending. I then decide to check my browser and load up websites or videos to ensure I am receiving a connection. The connection is fine, everything else works as intended apart from Skype. This typically lasts anywhere from 1 minute to 5 before the messages will all suddenly send at once.2. Accidental CallsIf you accidentally hit the keys Ctrl+Q, you have hit the short keys to initiate a call within Skype. Typically, this happens when the user has accidentally hit Ctrl rather than Shift. Now, if you call someone and did not mean to, the easiest thing to do is press the cancel call button before the other person answers. However, after having tested this specifically 10 times in a row, both my skype program and the other users skype that receives the call, crashes and stops responding. I tested this multiple times and without fail, every single test, it had the same result of both participants skype not responding.3. Skype on Mobile Skype on mobile is simply not a viable option whatsoever. Regardless of how powerful the hardware your phone sports, Skype will inevitably hit a stand-still and is required to be shut down and reloaded. It starts out fine, being able to type at any speed you're capable of. However, as typing goes on, the keyboard begins to lag and suddenly you're having to slow yourself down to pressing individual letters slowly and steadily while the on-screen keyboard has a chance to catch up.At this point, to prevent it getting worse, you are required to close the app and re-open to refresh. This happens without fail on a regular basis.Conclusion: Skype has many issues that require immediate attention, yet regardless of how many complaints are put online and how many issues are voted highly in the realms of needing fixed, Skype falls silent. We have updates that change the appearance and interface of Skype, giving it a new look and feel, however the same issues from the past persist. If skype wishes to compete with other upcoming services, they really need to begin listening to their user base and not shunning them.Review date: 26th August 2017 Skype version: 7.39.0.102 (most up to date version at the time of this review)",1,0.052,0.884,0.064,0.7675

Everything seemed great, then one day I received an email stated my email address had changed, then shortly after I received two emails from PayPal referring to two successful payments to Skype (this was all at the beginning of Oct 2013). I had not changed my email or made the payment so I tried to contact Skype, unfortunately Skype don't have a helpline number, they do have web chat but you need to log in, and at this time my password had also been changed by the person that had taken over my account. So I had to complete an online form, I received a reference and a note stating someone would contact me within 24hours. At this point someone was taking money from my account and Skype wanted me to wait, I contacted PayPal who stated that the payment was automatic so couldn't be stopped, so I phoned my bank, they stopped all payment to PayPal and the payment in process. So the next day I received an email from Skype stating that something with my request was incorrect and I was to follow a link to complete an online form, I selected the link which took me to the same page as I completed the day before, so I completed the form and also emailed Skype contactus address, again the message stated I would receive and email within 24 hours and again the same email back, to complete the online form. I replied to the emails but with no response, this went on until later November. So as I was getting nowhere I started to get fed up, so I tried the forgot password link after a few weeks of trying to change my password, I received a new one. So I could now access my account, when I logged into the account I noticed I was in credit for the two payment, so I tried the web chat to solve the problem but the guy told me to follow a link or try the contactus email, the link was for the online that I completed at the start, but I tried the form again but was still doing something wrong so nobody would help me, so I asked the online chat to help but again the same link. This went on for a bit, then in about March 2014 I received an email stating my account had been taken over so was block to protect me (5 months after I reported it), I tried to resolve the issue but got fed up, so stopped using Skype. It is now January 2015 and received an email stating my balance is due to expiry, this is to an account that is blocked. I am not saying don't use Skype because the free service is good but what ever you do don't use any paid service because your money isn't safe.

912,"Removing Subscriptions: A web of confusion and deceptionI have been a skype user since there were just 30,000 users on the system. A long time. I have enjoyed many good years and hundreds of hours with friends and relatives all over the world.On the strength of this I created a Business account, added my credit card details, added work colleagues, never really benefitted from group screen sharing because it never worked and it turned out to be an expensive console to add or remove members.I have tried to cancel the subscription on my credit card, but it has not been possible because it tells me I should transfer credits to a user before I can do this. There is no way to do this because the web page for months has given me a system error. Today I received another subscription payment notification with my credit card statement...just to add further insult to injury! It's not even possible to delete an account. What's that all about? Even Facebook deletes photos now!Skype customer services hides behind pages of inter-linked information that goes around in circles of Q&A pages and when I have been able to find a mail address to write to I don't get an answer.Very disappointing.
