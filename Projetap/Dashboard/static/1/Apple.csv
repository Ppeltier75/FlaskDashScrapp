5,"Apple regard us with the utmost contemptChristmas Day, and I wasn't able to configure my HomePods, because after a system update they perpetually showed a status of 'Loading configuration'. I tried to contact support, and on over a dozen occasions their website informed me they would call me 'in 2 minutes or less'. No call materialised. So I went through to cancel subscription support, figuring this would get results, and it did, immediately I was able to chat to an advisor, who profusely apologised and booked me a new call for 20 minutes later. Again, no call materialised. There is something to be learned from this. That is that Apple regard us, the user, the customer, with the utmost contempt. We are clearly just base scum as far as they are concerned, and we do not warrant the time of day unless their dirty dollars are in jeopardy. Let that be a lesson to all of us! If you haven't learned it yet, I can guarantee that you certainly will do soon. Finally, anybody notice how little communication there is from Apple on this review page?

I called the horrible customer service people who have absolutely no customer service skills. One rep told me if they deny it the second time I can go to the bank and dispute charge. Another rep told me if I go to the bank my apple account will be disabled which I’m pretty sure is illegal. Won’t be purchasing any thing more from apple because they decided to be so cheap about $42.

While I spare you the exhaustive list of problems spanning over a decade, my recent encounter with the 16"" M2 Macbook Pro, draining 4500 euros from my pockets, is the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.Barely weeks after unwrapping the overpriced beast, it descended into chaos, plagued by a series of maladies culminating in faulty memory modules. A whopping 10 months of enduring this technological horror show, and here I am, on day 4 without my device. Apple, with its trademark indifference, expects me to patiently wait until sometime late next week for its return. Each passing day is not just a lost day but a direct hit on my earnings.This marks the bitter end of my dalliance with Apple. The astronomical price tags they attach to their products no longer masquerade the glaring performance issues and the abysmal lack of responsibility exhibited by their customer service. While their support team can muster a friendly facade, it crumbles when it comes to compensating users for their troubles, expediting repairs, or admitting any wrongdoing. According to the latest Apple messenger, once the initial 14-day grace period (thanks to EU law) expires, it's open season on the hapless customer.I refuse to be the financial lifeline for a company that shamelessly shirks accountability for the subpar quality of its products. It's crystal clear to me that Apple's devices are designed to decay with each passing generation, forcing users into a perpetual cycle of repairs, upgrades, and wasted money.

107,"No aftercare for faulty AirPods Pro - Avoid this product.Very disappointed - no aftercare.I was gifted a set of AirPods Pro in late 2020, just under 2 years ago I noticed there was a crackling noise in the odd/rare occasion, perhaps once every few months. More recently (now 3 years), the left one has been making this noise constantly.I booked into Bromley Apple Store for advice and was told:- This is a very common problem- It was not purchase at this store- It will cost me (approximately) £80+ vat per pod to repair. So just shy of around £50 for a new set.The family and I have been Apple users for years… considering another member of the family had theirs replaced at no cost under similar circumstances, I think this if very unfair and also shows double standards. If this is a common problem, customers should be made aware and there should be more in place to support customers with this product and issue. I would expect better from Apple, the lack of aftercare has really put the family and I off. Serial GRJD530QLKKTModel A2084",1,0.147,0.824,0.029,-0.9614

I was unable to re-install it after finding it had been deleted (don't know how as I have no recollection of removing it). We spent quite some time going through various options (all of which I had tried before but I know customer support have to go through their script) to try and get it back. Having no luck his final suggestion was to reset my iPad which I was unwilling to do and I said I would finish the support call as it was getting late. However, his signing off comment was that it was a known fault and Apple were looking into it. A few days later Apple released iPadOS 16.7.4 which resolved the problem. However my comment is, if it was a known problem, why did customer support and I have to spend half an hour or more trying various options to resolve it. Both of us could have avoided a lot of unnecessary wasted time. But, on the positive side, the support person was pleasant and patient.

BUT, I've been backing up my data to iCloud for nearly 15 YEARS, and I NEVER missed a month's subscription fee. Apple continues to raise their Apple One subscription cost every year, and they could care less about customer loyalty. I ask for a ONE MONTH pause, but my only options are downgrading or cancelling, and losing 15 YEARS of data (unless I find a way to back everything up... and BTW, instructions to do this aren't readily available on the Apple Support site, because they don't want anyone to cancel their subscription! God forbid they should lose $26.00/month!). Used to be that I paid $9.99/month for 2 TB of data, but now they have it structured so that I have to keep one of their other services (Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc...) ON TOP OF my iCloud data, but since they bundled everything into the Apple One, I don't have the option to downgrade to data only. While I don't want to lose my Apple Music either, I have to pay a MINIMUM of $16.99 this month. Greed is driving this world, and everyone is complacent. It's been normalized, while those of us down on the bottom of the food chain, are struggling to make ends meet, while these guys care more about their gains or losses from the last quarter...  OMG! They lost a fraction of a point last quarter. Let's raise all of our Apple One subscriber's fees by $2.00. They can afford $26.00 a month, and if they can't, oh well. Too bad. If you're a TRILLION dollar company, YOU CAN AFFORD to let your customer go a month or two without paying the fee, and if the subscriber wants to reinstate their account a month or two later, THEY CAN PAY THE FEES later! For example, if I paused my account for a month, when I reinstate my account next month, I pay an extra $9.99, because they kept my data in my iCloud. I'm not saying they should keep my data indefinitely, but they should care way more about their loyal customers than their bottom line!Thanks for reading my review. I'm not some pathetic, broke, whiny jerk. I'm just someone who doesn't have much money this month, and my dog is sick, but because of little stuff like this, I have to choose my dog or 15 years of data.",1,0.126,0.771,0.103,-0.7717

After 3 days, I only received a ph call yesterday and no update today.. except a survey now, business as usual like nothing happened as if my new Iphone is up and running except not with me!!!

Was 6 months of purchased through Apple but it was impossible to order in time for Xmas on their site even though it stated it was available for Xmas .That was bad but the worst bit was when I tried to claim my 2 months of Apple Music .

From there laptop side of the business since moving to all aluminium laptops they have been great and work really well and are real sturdy which is important for someone who travels a lot. Coming from a IT background also the last thing i want to do is fix my own laptop when i get home from work so its good that Mac OS is stable and works well unlike windows. The only reason i will dock them a star is that they really should have not dropped 32 bit support for Mac OS as this caused things that i have installed to break and there is no chance that the software that broke will ever get updated by the original creator so not being able to use these apps is a bit of a issue.,4,0.027,0.807,0.165,0.9843

The second level of tech-support you get aren’t much better and also answer that the question wrong, which I figured out by googling.  That’s right. You can get a better answer from Google in 30 seconds about an Apple product than you can from Apple tech-support. The third level of support is called a senior advisor and they actually know what they are talking about but it takes an hour and a half to two hours to get to one. Good luck.

Spending 240 on Beats earpods is insane to begin with however I needed something that would hold up on daily runs and likes the waterproof feature.  After 5 days of ownership the right earpod stopped working.  I went to apple and even though I had apple care I was told they needed to be sent back for repair.  They were returned promptly with the same issue present.  After calling customer support again I was told I needed to pay a deposit on my credit card and they would get me replacements.  Once the replacements were back they would credit me.  Annoying but understandable.  These replacements worked for about a week however the right stopped charging again.  At this point I was able to determine that it was the charge case and set a appointment up with the local store.  Again they had to send them back but I marked the charge case.  Upon the shipment back to me I noticed the charge case was still the exact same it was not replaced.  I am now on the phone again trying to get this taken care of.

Are you kidding me? In what world a call back program has a ""window"", does a defect product magically disappear after time? I had to warn them that I would take legal action. After speaking with 4 people and prepping a legal threat letter, they finally accepted to replace it. I had to go to UPS to ship it to them. I insisted that I didn't want to get a refurbished model from the same - defective - model. They assured me that I would get a brand new, latest, whole new airpods pro. Then I saw in the repair shipping notification that they replaced only the earbuds, not the case... I called them back. The customer service incompetent agent on the phone who was ""in charge"" and placed the replacement request of my repair case told me that because of the way the repair was formatted in the first place, only the earbuds could be replaced. Why would you not tell me IN THE FIRST PLACE as I asked him to confirm once the request was placed?? NOW WAIT FOR IT, THERE IS MORE!

181,"The worst Apple Support experience everI purchased an Apple Watch Ultra 2 in NYC to be used in France. Before purchasing the watch, I obtained conflicting information (from Apple Support and from Apple staff) on whether it would be compatible in Europe. Nevertheless, I went ahead and purchased the watch but then decided to return the watch but was convinced otherwise by Apple sales staff . They guaranteed me that the watch will absolutely work in Europe (the Ultra 2 had one model only A2986 for Europe and the US as opposed to the older Ultra that had one for each region). A week later, armed with my new watch in France, I proceeded to activate it but couldn’t get the cellular service to work so I called Apple Support to get assistance and there again I received conflicting information: initially I was told that the watch should work in France (with service provider Orange) but by the end of the call I was told to exchange the watch in a local Apple shop (about an hour away by car) for a “European” model. So I did just that (had to wait for a week for the model to arrive in the shop then go and collect it again). The model i received was exactly the same model i retuned (A2986). So I activate the watch, then same problem occurred again (no cellular service). I called Apple Support again and was told to check with my service provider (Orange). This was never suggested during my first call with Apple Support ! Anyway, I called Orange to highlight the issue and within 24 hours the Apple Watch started to work properly. In conclusion, highlighting my entire experience, I spent over 8 hours with Apple Support over the phone, drove 75km to the local Apple Shop, exchanged a watch that should have never been exchanged, was without a watch for over a week thanks to (or really no thanks) to Apple Support. I never got an apology, any sort of compensation nor any explanation from Apple Support on this despite numerous promises.

184,"My Mother is Unable to Erase Her Old Phone Due a Locked iCloud AccountMy Mother had no issues with iCloud until about 2 weeks ago when her iPhone 13 Pro Max was updated to IOS 17.1.2. As a result of the update, Her iCloud Account got Locked as a result of failed password attempts which requires verification to unlock and reset the password which fails with every attempt that is made. She initially thought that the issue was due to her phone being outdated. When She Ordered a Brand New iPhone 15 Pro Max from T-Mobile as a trade in Upgrade which requires the old phone to be erased and shipped to them after setting up the new phone. As soon as She began to set the device up, the issue progressed to the point where she had to call T-Mobile to manually activate Her new phone as a result of failing to automatically activate the new phone and failing to deactivate the old phone during data transfer. After activating the new phone, T-Mobile transferred her to Apple Support where She ended up with a rude representative who immediately blamed her for the issues with the iCloud Account such as false claims of deleted data when She cannot even get into the iCloud Account with the old phone in recovery mode on iTunes to erase the data. He proceeded to tell her that this happens to a lot of users and basically there was nothing He can do to recover the iCloud account. When my mother ordered my iPhone 15 from the same carrier, I did not have any issues with data transfer nor phone number transfer with my old iPhone 11 through my iCloud Account. As a result of Her conversation with the representative, She cannot erase the data from Her old phone nor return it to T-Mobile as it requires account verification which ends up failing and sending a password reset request in which support would then fail to respond to the request as if it were being ignored by the representatives. She sent at least three requests and did not receive a response from support for 2 weeks when it should have been received within 24 hours as stated on the webpage. I also heard about the update leading to a black screen which can potentially make some devices unusable without iTunes, recovery mode, and iCloud. I'm Furious with the representative failing to come up with a resolution for the iCloud recovery issue. The phone costs $1200 with payments being up to $50 per month from T-Mobile as part of the trade in offer. A failed trade in would result in a significant increase in the phone bill and termination of the offer. If my mother were to go to the Apple Store, She would be sitting there for over 4 hours for one appointment only to be told that they cannot help Her. I think Apple owes IOS users money for all of the frustration that came with the IOS update because they cannot help IOS users when they need help recovering their devices or iCloud accounts that were affected by the update. I want Apple to employ another method that has been used in the past which can help recover or erase devices with an inaccessible Apple ID which is what's needed in the next patch that is released by Apple with IOS and the iTunes app on PC and Mac.",1,0.093,0.885,0.023,-0.9905
185,"Apple customer support centre do not care about their customersI am with apple for 9 years now. Changing phone to new model every 2 years. I bought iPhone 15 recently and got was working well for month or so. I observed 2 things yesterday - 1) Phone is not getting charged with my charger in Car. While other IPhone of my spouse and daughters are getting charge as normal. This is despite I am using original charging cord received from Apple.2) Battery started draining with super fast speed despite all kill all sessions and Apple which were running....Almost better was draining 1% / minute. This is extremely abnormal with new phone. I called customer support they did not checked on my phone and ran some test and later suggested to visit Apple support centre. I took appointment and visited support centre yesterday. They also ram test. Agent suggested to set the phone to factory setting and he promised all Apps will be restored as it from cloud backup. only text message will be lost as this is not backed up. He cleared agreed than all my apps, in curtain non critical apps you store password as well and it was confirmed they it will work as it is. I agreed for resetting to factory setting. but nothing was reset right. Then was I was ask to download all apps and login....I had >100 apps and it was impossible to remember all. There are few data and files you had which I was not able to recover. I spoke to the location manager there....to my surprise he also confirmed...apple are there in iCloud but I need to download all, arrange as it was earlier in groups and folders and login every App. I told him that when I switch from old phone to new phone, Apple support centre on call use to transfer and replicate everything as it from old phone to new phone. This transition was always seamless and you will not get a feel of any change other than physical device. But store manager did not agreed and he said it is NOT possible. I had to leave store with disappointment. half a day of Sunday gone and you have the work on Sunday to get your phone back. Absolutely pathetic customer support. I tole him that this is possible and I did multiple time with help of 24x7 customer support when I switch from old phone to new phone, but as per Manager I met there, this is not possible.Regarding my battery drain problem, They said they cannot do anything unless they discover problems at their end. There are NO way for them to track the how the phone battery is behaving. This was absurd issue I discovered and they Apple is not ready for any support in this case. This problem is not persistent, hence in case this observed again, I have to through out my Apple phone and change phone with other non-Apple device. I think next time I have to record for long video 30 min to 1 hrs showing how the battery is draining for Apple users to be aware of. Few suggestions for Apple -  # They need to have customer support staff better trained and communicate clearly.  # Device mechanism to checks issue in detail and device tools for the same. I and my family is big Apple fan for last 9 years and all products we had is Apple (Phone, Mac, iPad), but this is disappointing experience which will make me think if we should shift out of Apple devices.

The greatest focus seems to be placed on, like AI bots - according to a pre-written template, telling the same things over and over again, as well as spending a lot of time telling ""that from now on they will take over the case"" from ex. employee ""to ensure that I, as a customer, feel secure that this person undertakes my case"" and so on and so on...

I as many people others have no home phone incase of emergency.  So my options are return for repair and have NO phone to work or if an emergency happens or buy a new phone. To me it’s a scam being it happened to two phone in two year time frame.  Tech told me that I should have back up phone available in my case that would mean purchasing two phones because other phone went to black screen. He also said when you buy a car and take off lot they break buyer beware.  I said all the cars I bought for decades they loan you a car till your is fixed. It’s a scam if it happened once is one thing but twice is another. I will not buy three Apple phones in two years at $800 to $1200 a pop. It’s a scam.

284,"Apple’s Lack of Accountability and Unjustified Price HikesWhile contacting Apple customer support about the 44% increase in Apple TV+, it brought back the previous incident I had with Apple Support and their lack of action to deal with issues of poor service, App fraud and unjustified price hikes.  Let me explain:I had purchased a one time/life time subscription to TapeACall Pro via Apple App Store. 22 months after purchasing TapeACall, they secretly charged my account $0.00 in order to change the subscription type I had, so that they could begin charging me a monthly fee. I contacted Apple and proved everything I am saying now. They told me they were not responsible, it was the App developer. I contacted the App developer who said I had to contact Apple. I provided emails to Apple to confirm this. Apple then said they are not responsible for what the developers do. I could not understand this at all as Apple is the one who sells the App. If you go to Walmart and buy a lamp that doesn’t work, you return it to Walmart. Walmart doesn’t tell you that it’s not their responsibility to correct this, that it’s the manufacturer. No other entity, nearly as big, as big, or bigger than Apple, has a policy where they hold no responsibility for what they sell. Apple Support Manager told me to make a review of the App on the App Store, I did - nothing happened. They said leave feedback on their website, I did - nothing happened. This was the senior support manager who was telling me this. Please understand, complaints, feedback and issues are put in a void that provides no response or intent to resolve. So why would anyone purchase anything from the Apple App Store knowing they refuse to be responsible… the Support Manager even told me there had been a plethora of complaints about this App, yet they kept selling it. If Apple doesn’t feel they have a fiduciary responsibility to either be responsible or hold the App developer responsible then I suggest Apple shouldn’t be able to sell anything that is from a third party. Imagine you went to the movies and purchased a drink with unlimited refills, but when you went to get a refill they said you had to pay for it. When you explain, and prove, that you were sold unlimited refills they tell you to contact Coke/Pepsi or leave the complaint on a feedback card (that no one ever looks at). Furthermore, they refuse to give you a refund and they continue selling drinks with unlimited refills that don’t actually have refills. Would you ever go back to that theatre?So now Apple has raised their Apple+ Tv subscription by 44%, but haven’t increased new content. In fact their new content has decreased. Additionally, they are now more expensive than Disney+ and Prime Video, but have a fraction of the content. There is no loyalty incentive or even a justification for the price increase. They are banking on being “Apple” and that people will just put up with it. There are many other large companies that thought they were to big to fail - Kodak, Blockbuster, Polaroid, Xerox and so many more. Knowing that inflation has gone up at nearly record levels, Apple has decided now is the time to increase their price - not just increase it at inflation rates, but instead 6 times the pinnacle inflation rate recently experienced. I have cancelled my Apple Subscription,  When it’s time to upgrade I will be buying an Android device, probably a Samsung or Google phone and will leave Apple in my rear view. In the age of customer experience, a company that has zero respect for the consumer should not expect any loyalty (think about them being caught purposefully slowing down phones in order to prompt consumers to buy a newer model). I’ll end with what I said to the Customer service representative and the Manager; why would I stay with Apple, when I’m doing way more for Apple than Apple does for me? As my devices age (laptop, wireless headphones, smart watch, tablet), I will replace these devices with other brands. I hope that more consumers who have negative experiences with Apple do the same. It’s the only way they will change.",1,0.072,0.85,0.078,0.9313

I’ve used Apple gear since 1996 and can honestly say every item of equip I’ve ever had (and they run into many of all types) don’t owe me a penny and have always performed as you’d expect and lasted many years. I’m still using a 2010 Mac Book Pro in everyday use!! I do wonder about some reviews, this one for instance from Oct 2023:‘Bought apple ipod pro from apple store, thinking that i could use my iPhone 14 charging cable no where said i couldn’t.Pods arrived and blow me down a different socket so i cant use my cable i already have so have to buy charging matNo where do you tell me this on purchase!Apple just money grabbing!Seriously considering swopping to another make of phone’. Well, there is no such item now as iPod Pro, maybe he means an iPad Pro? It comes with a charging lead (but not a charger) in the box. Then he says ‘Pods arrived… so does he mean EarPods? EarBuds come in a case that charges the buds, once again with a lead to charge them. I do think some people just love attacking Apple. Reviewers talk about software slowing the phone down, in my experience and I’ve had at least 6 iPhones now I’ve never had issues like that.

315,"The apple experienceI have cancer. I am supposed to lower my stress, but I am making myself sick dealing with Apple and this bull. I almost passed out walking out the mall and crashed when I got home to print yet another document missing my 3rd appointment at the apple store. This will be my fifth time going into the store to prove it's my phone. They don't check ids or passports or me logging into my account and showing them I own the phone. NOPE, they want a printed piece of paper that shows the phone was mailed to me. Three different people at the store gave me 3 different requests for what they need in a document. I am officially being given the run around. The first person said proof I own it. Brought that in to be told it needs to have the date I purchased it. Which get this, it was on the first one. So I brought a second one, the contract I signed for the phone. No we need a receipt, proof that it was shipped to you and how much you paid for it. All on the contract and Huh, so when I pushed back I was told it has to have the imei number on it WHICH WAS ON THE FIRST ONE.What is this! Thieves would have an easier time getting my phone fixed than I do. The person who owns it. Bought it and pays for it every month. Sporting the watch it's linked to, but that means nothing. In fact I have a legacy contact. If something happens to me, heaven forbid, she would have an easier time getting my information from apple than I do.Is this reality I am living in!Apple is useless!! My phone is broken and I'm locked out of my apple Id now. Which, now this is my favorite part, I have the apple key but it NO LONGER WORKS ON APPLE'S NETWORK. It only works from the device itself... my broken device I can't fix because I can't prove it was shipped to me. I have to prove I ordered the phone to get the phone fixed to get in the phone to use the key which can only be used in the broken phone.I hope reading that gave you a headache and made you go Wth. Then you'll be somewhat closer to where I am mentally right now. The man on the phone with support response was, ""yeah you shouldn't have done that (create the key) because they JUST changed the policy. There always changing the polices so this is new."" Get this, apple is the one who told me to get create the key when I bought the phone!I have an apple watch which stopped working and wouldn't let me unlock my phone, also not proof that it's my phone. They legit asked me if I had another apple device that I can use to unlock my phone, which wouldn't have worked anyway, but why seriously because the first two products are working so well! I was going to buy an iPad. But thank GOD I didn't!The first guy in the store actually told me to go home find a friend with an apple device to help me reset my password. So when I called apple customer service online and got the 3rd person, she was like, ""the APPLE store couldn't help you change your password!?? They have apple devices for this very reason."" I was like SISSSSSSSS!! She started laughing and apologized but ""that's the dumbest thing I ever heard."" Bruh!!!!!! This was the only ""genius"" I have spoken with at apple. This last genius legit looked me in my face and said, "" we just want to prove it's your phone."" Bruh where is an attorney when you need one! I ask myself everday how is this my life right now. I woke up one morning, phone on the charger completely dead. Thinking its probably just a battery issue. The tech told me they have the part and it will take an hour to fix but I need the login information. Now, I'm playing a horrible game of whose phone is it really. I am exhausted, and for me that means a whole lot right now. As a person with medical issues who lives alone, this is a dangerous place to be and I am going on day 6 without access.

I was working on my laptop on Saturday when, for no apparent reason, the screen started flickering. I contacted Apple support, but they informed me that I would have to address this issue myself because it's out of warranty. I'm quite disappointed with Apple since I invested $3,500 in what I expected to be a reliable tool.Now, my only option is to send it back to Apple, which will cost me even more money. The frustrating part is that they've designed the laptop in a way that makes it impossible to replace just the cable connecting the screen to the laptop; I'd have to replace the entire screen, even though it still functions properly when at the right angle.Apple is asking for another $1,300 to make it work again. It's not just about the money; it's also about the inconvenience of not having my laptop for 2 or 3 weeks. I run an online business, and this issue is affecting it significantly. It's also a waste of resources, transportation, and energy. I'm truly disappointed with Apple. I thought I was buying a quality product.

Ok… with that being said why are Apple care covers not designed for theft and lost on AirPods. Those AirPods cost the person who bought them for me £169 less than 6 months ago and they just sold me a new charging case for £79.

392,"Apple is horribleI wanted to express my deep disappointment with my recent experience using Apple services and products. I believe it is essential to provide feedback when customers face issues, in the hope that it can lead to improvements in the future.Recently, I received a small sum of money (less than $100) via the Apple Cash app, which prompted a sudden and unexpected request for extensive personal information verification. This included my name, address, email, the last four digits of my social security number, and then also my full social security number. Understandably, given recent incidents of fraud on another credit card, I was skeptical about providing such sensitive information. Regrettably, my decision to test the system by entering ""123456789"" led to me being locked out of my Apple Cash account.Desperate to resolve the issue, I reached out to Apple Support earlier today, where I spoke with Richard and his supervisor, Alicia. To my disappointment, they informed me that I had been suspended from using Apple Pay, and there was no apparent way to lift this suspension. Furthermore, I learned that I couldn’t create a new account without using my social security number, a requirement that Apple strictly enforces.I've noticed a concerning decline in the overall quality of Apple's products and services. iPhones, which were once known for their reliability and innovation, appear to have lost their charm. Similarly, the experience with Apple's services has deteriorated, as evident in my recent ordeal with Apple Cash. This has left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration.Given the aforementioned issues, I've made the difficult decision to discontinue my use of Apple services and to part with all Apple products I own, including my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, iMac, and Apple TV. It saddens me to take this step, as I have been a long-time Apple customer, but I feel it is necessary to protect my personal information and seek more reliable alternatives.I hope that my feedback can contribute to improving the experiences of other Apple users in the future.

397,"Not worth wasting time on preordersI have made my first and last preorder with Apple.  I had to fill out the order form 3 times because it kept entering my old information from prior purchases.  I elected to purchase the protection plan for the new iPhone 15 Pro Max which was not to be billed to my bank until the said new phone had been activated.  The receipt I received (sent to an old email address; not the current address I put on the order form) only gave an order number and the name of the item I purchased; no shipping address.The expected ship date was given as between 10/09/23 and 10/15/23 (I preordered on 09/15/23).  I received a notification for fraudulent activity from my bank on 10/03/23 because Apple had billed my first protection plan fee even before the phone was even shipped, much less activated.  When I contacted Apple regarding the charge, their only remedy to the problem was to cancel the protection plan and said I had 60 days to reapply after I received the phone.I also received an email (once again to the old email address) on 10/03/23 that my phone was being prepared for shipment and provided a tracking number.  When I tracked it, they had sent it to an old address and not the address I entered on the order form.  Another 45 minutes on the phone with Apple and the representative said he would request an address change to the shipping company.  Another email (yes, you guessed it - sent to the old email address) said they had contacted the shipping company but there was no guarantee that it would actually change.  At that time, the tracking number was showing a delivery date if 10/05/23.  Since then, the tracking only shows “Delay” or “ Mechanical Failure”.  So I guess my phone will float around in China for a while.The entire preorder process was more trouble than it is worth.  Apple clearly needs to pay attention to individual order information and act accordingly.  Just because an email address and shipping address was one thing 3 years ago does not mean they are still current.

415,"Apple Store on George Street is the WORST SHOP IN CITY.I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with the terrible experience I had at the Apple Store on George Street in Sydney.I arrived around 9:20 AM, approximately one hour after receiving the notification that my order was ready for pickup. I joined the queue and checked in with the staff, as per the usual procedure. I specifically requested that they install the screen protector for me. To my astonishment, the employee who checked me in informed me that the screen protector they sell in-store, which they can install, is different from the one I had purchased online. He stated that they couldn't install the one I bought online. This came as a complete surprise, and I asked him what could be done. He suggested they would refund my online purchase and provide me with the in-store screen protector, which they could install. I found it odd that this information was not conveyed online during my purchase, but I agreed to the change.However, what followed was a wait of an excruciating one hour with no progress. I complained multiple times to both the initial employee and other team members, but they repeatedly apologized and asked me to wait. When I arrived at the store, the queue only consisted of me and two others, and when I left, it was still just a few more customers waiting. Meanwhile, I observed many other customers buying phones and getting their screen protectors installed on the spot. My frustration reached its limit, and I demanded my order without the installation. Again, I was asked to wait. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my order was handed over.To my disbelief, I noticed an installer standing idle for more than 10 minutes after I had received my order. I approached him, hoping to purchase a new screen protector and have it installed, but he informed me that I would have to wait another 20-30 minutes. I couldn't comprehend this, as I had already waited for an hour. He insisted that he had other customers to attend to. This was beyond frustrating.I escalated the issue to the manager, but to my dismay, he echoed the same response. This level of disrespect is utterly unacceptable. I understand that spending $2000 at the Apple Store doesn't make me their most important customer, but why couldn't they simply install the screen protector when I had already waited for an hour, and their installer was just standing idle?This experience is a disgrace to Apple and stands in stark contrast to the sleek and customer-friendly image that their advertisements portray.",1,0.101,0.847,0.052,-0.9758

426,"Bought Apple products after hearing how…Bought Apple products after hearing how good they are and nothing compares to them. I came to the conclusion that some Apple-sheep can't understand technology and trends, therefore they can't even compare.To mention I never had before an Apple product.1. Bought an iPhone 13 mini. Lovely phone. Good for calling. Not good for writing messages (for my medium sized hands). I was kinda disappointed to see that the iOS is far from perfection, as it's marketed. Had lots of freezing, apps error and closing, hangings on loading iOS apps (not those from App Store). So there is went the myth with the perfect smartphone OS. I liked though that I could hear calls a bit better than on an Android smartphone I'm using in parallel. The speaker also sounds more bassy...2. AirPods 3rd Gen: I like them, they sound good, but not very loud. The battery depleted by itself many times, when not used. So I must charge them every week or so. I use some Huawei mostly, because they connect to two devices at once. The AirPods can't do that. And it's annoying.3. MacBook Air M1 (8GB, 256GB): I liked the MacOS. Mostly a good experience for programming, browsing, multimedia. Good speakers. But something I wasn't expecting: if (and I do lots of times) I have too many tabs opened in the browser, the browser (at least) freezes completely. I must to Force Quit the app from the Task Manager or what's called. When the RAM is full many apps are hanging too and it becomes useless. And I can't upgrade the RAM. And to buy 32GBs of RAM unit is out of discussion. It's extremely expensive. I'll have my Lenovo Legion 5 with 64GB of RAM and 3TBs on SSDs doing the hard job. Ahh, forgot: compared to Windows, waking the MacBook from sleeping mode happens instantly. This is really nice.4. iPad Mini 6 WiFi 64GB/ 5G & WiFi 256GB: bought the WiFi version to use it for navigation, as compared to an Android tablet it takes both Apple Maps and Google Maps (both they do great job). Learned the expensive way that the WiFi version doesn't have a GPS module. Lol. The cheapest possible Android tablet I ever had, it had GPS. You just tether your smartphone's WiFi and voilà, you have internet on the tablet. Not on the WiFi version of this iPad Mini 6. So had to buy the Cellular version again. The latest works just fine. Lags sometimes with both navigation apps opened on split screen, but it's ok.5. iPad Pro 11 M1 2021 (8GB RAM, 128GB ROM): bought this for gaming and it's a monster. I even edited some videos and this thing is fast. Bought for my brother the Galaxy Tab S8 (8GB RAM, 256GB ROM, 5G) and the Samsung has more options for the user (Samsung DEX at least) and it came with a keyboard AND the pen. All for under 600£ with student price. Anyway, I still like iPad Pro. I bought a Logitech keyboard, as the original is way too expensive to worth. I'd buy the pen, but 120£? Really?Anyway, to end my review for Apple: it's just another company trying to lure the customers into buying their products. It's all about the money. But it's far from any perfection some fans are bragging. Before buying the 13 Mini, I bought a SE202 to see how's an iPhone. I had AppleCare+ for it. And sold it, but cancelling the Coverage can't be done through Apple platform. Must call them and it's hugely annoying. It's not something straight.",4,0.037,0.871,0.092,0.9878

432,"Terrible Experience with Apple Refurbished WebsiteI wanted to buy an iPad for my daughter.  She had a gift card that I was using (with her permission), which limited the choices I had; most new iPads were more expensive, and I opted to try the Apple website that offered refurbished iPads.  Note that this was an official Apple website, not a third-party one.It was a terrible experience, and I would advise anyone to avoid using this site.  I first tried to order an 8th-generation iPad in Space Gray, the color my daughter preferred.  The item was shown as available on the website. The cost was acceptable given the amount of her gift card.  The order appeared to go through, but a day later, I was advised that the order was canceled.  I called Apple and was told that unfortunately the Space Gray was out of stock.  Worse, Apple had put a ""hold"" on the amount of the purchase, and I had to wait for that to clear before I could use the full amount of the gift card again.Forewarned by this experience, I first called Apple to check that the next color choice for this generation of iPad (silver) was in stock.  I was told it was.  Once the hold on the card cleared, I ordered the silver.  Apple accepted the order, and I received an email saying the order was ""in process"" and was projected to be delivered on a certain date.  That date passed without any progress on the order. I then received an email saying that THIS order was canceled.  I called Apple again and was told, again, that the color was out of stock.  Another ""hold"" was placed on the gift card and, as of 2 days after the cancellation, the hold is still in effect, preventing me from buying an iPad somewhere else.I have used Apple products for years and have been very happy with their design and functionality.  However, this experience has undermined my confidence that Apple cares about its customers.  This borders on improper consumer practices.True, my daughter has not lost any money - this would be consumer fraud - but the time and effort I've spent trying to buy a product that appeared to be available (or was confirmed to be available) on Apple's website was completely wasted, and my daughter still does not have an iPad.Again, I advise you not to expect the Apple refurbished website to be reliable or able to fulfill your orders.",1,0.073,0.827,0.1,0.9193

It has been nothing short of a nightmare.I eagerly bought the iPhone 15 Pro yesterday with high hopes, only to be met with a barrage of issues as soon as I got home. The very basic task of transferring files from my old phone to the new one proved to be a Herculean challenge. In my desperate attempts to resolve this matter, I contacted your support team, who suggested subscribing to a monthly iCloud backup service for a fee of 3 pounds. I complied, thinking this would be the solution to my problems, only to find out that it did not resolve the issue.Upon contacting your support team for the second time, I was recommended to transfer the files via my Mac. To my dismay, this too proved to be futile. I have spent an excruciating 1.5 days trying to achieve what should have been a straightforward task.It wasn't until my fourth contact with your customer support that I was informed that the problem lies with the software on the new phone. This revelation left me utterly frustrated and disappointed. I decided to visit your store with hopes of getting a replacement, but to my astonishment, I was denied the opportunity to thoroughly inspect the replacement device to ensure it was functioning correctly. I left the store empty-handed, having wasted 7 pounds on parking, 10 pounds on fuel, and an additional 3 pounds on iCloud services.This weekend has been a deplorable experience, marred by incompetence and a lack of support.

Trade in and a new MacBook Pro. Only a year later it broke for no reason. The logic board just fried itself.  No spills, no bangs, not using the computer for anything excessive.  $700 repair later? It kept crashing and less than a year later? The logic board fried itself again.  No reason.  It was literally working one day and broken the next, again.  Apple would like to replace the exact same part for another $700.  This would be the third logic board in as many years.  That is a total cost of $4,400 to have a computer than might be functional again for another year?  What!?! Worse?  You can quickly find reviews indicating that multiple customers are having the same problem while Apple plays dumb. If customers pay premium prices for computers, they should be getting a computer that actually works.  I feel like I got absolutely robbed by Apple.  No one at Apple cares in the least that a premium computer is blowing out for absolutely no reason - all they seem to care about is getting access to my wallet.  I’d like a computer that actually works if I am paying five times the rate for a computer.  There is literally nothing I could have done differently with this computer and it’s fried … again.

And the only way to turn that off is by pressing the power button three times to turn on some idiot, privacy mode which freezes you in the current app and the only way to get out is to press the button three times again and put in a passcode. and yes, you are correct, EVERY TIME. so if you want to privately play a game or app, you have to go through that god awful process. Just bring back the home button, it really does make your product exponentially better.Another thing, I am attempting to set up a genius bar appointment, but my phone is disconnected from cellular AND wifi cause my iPhone 12, like I said, is just a brick with pretty colors. Of course, I forgot my password, and as I try to reset it, guess where it tells me to check for the code, my pretty little brick.So, I can't even set up a genius appointment to fix my  phone, because for some goddamn reason, I need my phone in order to reset my password..... -_-Seriously Apple product team, please go use your product. Its really sad when I get led into circles by your stupid system cause you guys can't get your crap together.I am now going back to Tmobile to return this iPhone 12 and get a Samsung product. Cause f##k no am I going to sit here as I wait for that code to send to my disconnected device that has had zero bars for the past 12 hours. >:(  And god, do I miss being able to emulate, not being restricted by Apple's ""protectionist"" policies, and simply being able to use my device without any stupid, minor setbacks like a retroactive home button that just pisses users off.

512,Be wary of Apple’s customer service …I have been an Apple supporter and buyer for many years I have all the Apple gadgets. That being said I am very disappointed recently with their customer service or lack of customer service. Everything is very rigid and you have to adapt to Apple. There is no way to give a negative feedback and only through Apple’s feedback service which says your feedback will be dealt with and you won’t be contacted. What is the point of filing a complaint if you won’t get the respect back from Apple to deal directly with you on this issue. To get refunds from Apple Store for Apps that they offer it’s all automated and fixed to limited reasons so personal circumstances aren’t dealt with and you won’t get any reason why your refund is rejected other than it’s part of their terms and conditions. The chat always push you to having calls with customer service senior advisors and some try and help but again others just say sorry read our terms and conditions. This is against the entire remit of transparency and consumer laws in Ireland. For example in Ireland you are entitled to 14 day cancellation for any service and that includes purchases in Apps and a full breakdown of what you bought. This didn’t happen and Apple customer service refused to hear me out or file a detailed complaint calling out their non compliance with Irish and EU law. Today I was offered randomly for a previous purchase of Apple Music for 6 months. I spent hours trying to get this sorted even had to contact my bank and the issue is with apple but again they say they want me to waste more time and have a senior adviser deal with matters via a call. So again limited to what Apple wants. The service and products to be honest or Apple have reduced in quality. My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is very disappointing as well. At this stage I amThinking of selling all my apple products and moving to Samsung. Honestly it’s disappointing how rigid Apple is in nit even allowing you to file complaints that will actually be dealt with.,1,0.108,0.836,0.056,-0.9553

My wife suffers with arthritis and needed to buy a new iPad due to dropping her old iPad several times. Sadly we arrived late after travelling 76 miles from mid Wales. We could not be seen for 15 minutes so we looked at the various iPads on display. When the sales person arrived, we explained that we wanted exactly the set up displayed. An iPad 10 instead of a 9 as my wife liked the keyboard with the 10. The salesman checked and said that there were no p8nk ones in stock. However, one could be sent to our home the next day. After difficulty with the pay machine, the deed was done and the salesman had checked that the info would be transferred to iCloud. We are of the older generation but looked forward to receiving the package next day, despite the possible difficulty in setting up. The package arrived after lunch. Unfortunately, the package only contained the iPad. No keyboard which was an important part of the deal.we tried contacting Apple to discuss the situation. Three times the phone hung up when trying to speak to someone. The fourth time, we had an answer and as we gave the order number, the line went dead again. We then tried three other numbers on Google, including the complaints number. All cut us off once we started giving the information. We then tried one of the numbers again and actually managed to speak to someone. We had to ask for them to speak louder as we could barely hear them. Also, it was extremely difficult to understand the lady. We were then told that our address was wrong despite us giving them our address and the parcel arriving. We spelled out the details and strangely, our address was right. We were eventually told that we had only bought the iPad. We had stressed that the package on display was exactly what we needed. We eventually asked for them to collect the package as it was of no value without the keyboard. She explained that it would cost another two hundred pounds for the keyboard. She then put us through to someone else as she was an engineer. Eventually, it was agreed for Apple to send us labels and we would arrange it collected from our home. We would have to wait until the item reached their factory and was checked before any refund. This would take another 3-5 days to refund. Terrible service all round.

It was still working when I retired it for a 2020 SE after they started zapping battery life on old models (I don’t buy the explanation they fed us on that one by the way). Now they make them to last 2 years max. I hardly use my phone (texts and light browsing) and it just drains. If I’m sleeping and it’s unplugged, it can easily die on its own. Well, the old “inferior” 5S battery didn’t do that. It’s a shame their only goal is to sell as many devices as possible - that’s inherently unethical. I recommend looking up a list of what goes into making a smart phone. There are limited amounts of the elements required to produce electronic devices and smart phones on the earth. There is no game plan to recycle these precious metals from existing devices, slow down, or cease mining for these. Instead, every year there’s a new iPhone, regardless of how piddling and insubstantial the updates are on it. I am not advocating a Luddite, phoneless existence - I am just asking Apple be reasonable and build fewer, enduring products instead of a frenzied existence of endlessly churning out new products to make shareholders richer. Since my SE 2020 isn’t faring well, I stepped into an Apple Store to look at current offerings the other day. When I mentioned I was interested in an older model, the sales associated pretended to look shocked and said, “are you ok being X # of phones behind?”. What an awful sales tactic- trying to shame or pressure customers to buy the latest and greatest, to be “in” on the hype.

I don't have any Apple products or services and no accessible accounts so couldn't understand the charge.The only thing I can think is that I signed up for EE Broadband and Mobile some time ago. EE completely messed up so I cancelled under the 14 day cooling of period. Part of the EE offer was free Apple TV or Music (I can't remember which) for X number of months. I took advantage of this offer for maybe two days, until I cancelled the EE services. Upon cancelling the EE services I also lost access to the Apple TV or Music. I am assuming that Apple mistakenly thought I was still on a free trial that has now expired and that this was a valid charge??After losing access I never gave it another thought until the charge occurred on my credit card.After the charge occurred, I found the only valid Apple account I had was one where my phone number was the username. Every time I tried to log in with that username, Apple wanted me to change the username to an email address and every time I entered one Apple said ""an error has occurred and wouldn't let me go any further. But I could see, but couldn't change or access, that that account had access to my credit card (I could see the last four digits). There was nothing else I could do - I couldn't log-in and therefore I couldn't see any orders or charges and I couldn't cancel or change anything.I'd had no prior notification of the charges and as far as I could ascertain this was daylight robbery - someone had taken my money without my permission. A blatant THIEF and it was APPLE. I contacted Apple by chat and explained everything. I thought it went well and I was understood. However, next I receive an email from Apple saying I understand you have an issue with iTunes! iTunes was never discussed  on chat and it was here that I thought this was going to end badly. Despite what was explained on chat, about the account username, they even requested the following:• The exact issue description and relevant order numbers (if applicable)• Your valid Apple ID email addressNeither of which I could supply.I replied to this email, attaching a transcript of the chat, and I have heard nothing back. I have since replied for a second time asking what is happening and I have still heard nothing. It seems I am being ignored on purpose.Apple, illegally, stole £6.99 off me and I want it back. I also want confirmation that they won't be trying to charge me anymore and that they have closed down all my inaccessible accounts. I don't have any need for their products and services and after this is resolved, I don't want anything to do with them ever again.I have had to cancel my credit card over this and have had to lodge a complaint with my CC provider over this unauthorised transaction as Apple have not assisted at all.I have upset my managers at work over this by refusing to use the £800 iPad Pro they have just given me and five other colleagues for a project. All six iPads are now being returned and being replaced with Samsung tablets. This has given me immense satisfaction because it is now reached a corporate level, even if I never get my £6.99 back.I partly blame EE for this mess won't ever use EE or Apple ever again.

597,Don’t use Apple Pay to buy a subscription if you want a refund.I purchased a subscription with Apple Pay without realizing the subscription would cost me 99.99. I requested a refund twice and they say I’m not eligible for a refund after I never used the app even after purchasing the subscription. I will be calling again tomorrow and demanding a refund or else they will be losing a customer and I WILL be switching to Samsung. This is absolutely crazy that they won’t refund me my money after accidentally purchasing a subscription. Definitely shocks me how greedy they are with the money they’re given.,1,0.166,0.796,0.038,-0.8832
598,They say they can’t do anythingI called Apple support because I got scammed through Apple Pay they said they can’t do anything so apparently it’s ok for someone to say they are selling you something and when you pay them they run off with your money at this point im considering not supporting their business,1,0.088,0.825,0.087,0.24

The only solution is to travel for an hour into the store and negotiate with the staff there who would rather be flogging equipment than give you the time of day.

606,Apple trade in is a scamDo not and I repeat do not send in your device for trade in thinking you’re gonna get more. They send you a box with no padding which then scratches the screen and they offer way way less. Then when your device gets back to you the screen is worse than how you had it. They send it in a loose box and it gets scratched more. So now you have a phone that previously had a flawless screen is now just ugly. Every person I talked to that have sent in their device gets the same memo. Dead or white pixels. Just sell it on eBay or mercari you will get way more for it.,1,0.12,0.854,0.026,-0.8979

This has cost me a job as the job required I download an app for work, the company was gonna pay my bill, but since I live in rural America and my nearest Apple Store is approximately 4 hours away the employer could not guarantee my position needless to say the position was filled by someone else. Then on top of that I’m trying to switch service providers and owe nothing on the phone nor do I owe money for service but I have to wait up to 72 hours for Apple to unlock my daughters phone so I sit here holding two phones that I own but cannot use because Apple thinks they can lockdown my phone until they feel convenient enough to push the button.

So, we got her a new phone.  Great idea. They drive an hour to my house to set it up.  Except that the account was now locked because of the 'too many wrong attempts at the pin' and the only way to unlock it was using her iphone which we couldn't access.Let's use her ipad to reset her password.  No, despite moving her sim card to a new phone so we could get the verification codes, the ipad nor the applied website would accept the verification codes being sent.So the support person after an hour tells us we have to recover the account and we'll get an email 24 hours later.  They drive back home.  I try today to see what's going on and read an email that says I have to wait 10 days to get things sorted and that apple can't make this go any faster.It's not ok.

I have only one product with apple and it's apple music, I pay a monthly subscription of £10.99 and have built up a play list for many years. This month apple decided to deactivate my apple ID for no reason. I contacted them to reactivate it for which they put requests in but was denied. They have given no explanation as to why it's been deactivated and have told me they could not reactivate it. I asked for this to be escalated and then spoke to a manager. The manager said he could not help my any further it's been deactivated and they could not retrieve any of my music, so years or downloading music has now gone. I then asked for some reason and explanation for which he could not give me, I asked to escalate it and he said I was speaking to a manager and he has noted this as a complaint but he cannot guarantee I will get any response to my complaint, to which I said that's not good enough, to which he said you can send a written complaint and I asked will I get a response, he said I cannot guarantee you will get a response. There is no accountability and no way to escalate any complaint. It's honestly shocking. I will never buy a product of apples again and warn anyone who has apple music to consider switching to someone else incase this happens to you. Oh and to really rub the salt in the wounds, yesterday I was charged £10.99 for my subscription that they cannot give me or give any reason why they can't give it me.I also asked to SAR for the call with the manager for which he said he will send me but not had any email from him to date",1,0.143,0.839,0.018,-0.9879

The Apple consultant said I could mail the phone in for repairs but it would cost $756. I asked her how do you know how to charge if you don’t know what’s wrong with the phone? I also had the battery replaced and paid $159. The phone continued to drain to the point that after 3 hours the phone would shutdown at night time it had to be left plugged in. On numerous occasions I told the Apple customer service people I suspected the IOS updates 16.4 to have done something to the phones battery. Apple-vehemently denied this. I also discovered friends, family and strangers to be suffering the same with their phones. In some cases people bought new phones. Last week there was an update 16.6 incredibly like a miracle my battery issue’s disappeared overnight. Was Apple testing me and others our patience to see if we would pay for a $756 repair or buy a new $1399 iPhone in the belief that our iPhones life was over. You be the judge to me this is coercion. As it is I have lost time and aggravation and $159 for nothing.What’s worse is that when I posted a warning to other users on Apple Support Community my post was removed.

Apple had more than enough information to reset the password but instead they put it in recovery mode. Customer service claims there’s nothing they can do but I don’t believe them and nothing they can do or say will change that. They are liars and they are lazy. What they can do better is actually do their jobs. They had the nerve to expect us to wait for fake recovery knowing they’re costing us a minimum 100.00 every day they prevent my husband from working by refusing to fix the problem.

The website shows without the student option for the product of $599 so in actuality you are not receiving $100 discount.

However, my call was terminated rather abruptly, leaving me in anticipation of whether the technician would return my call. Unfortunately, she did not. While I try to be understanding, I can't help but notice an unfortunate pattern; both Apple and HP have cut my line, with the incidents invariably involving female technicians. I can somewhat understand this from HP, given their recent dip in customer service quality, but I expect more from Apple. Following the incident, I asked the technician to have a supervisor contact me post-investigation, much like a similar request I made to HP, yet neither yielded any response.

The apple is nothing more than a scam machine, a machine that costs more than a thousand dollars just to fry eggs because of its poor heat. The keyboard is very bad, appearing for a long time, many people complain but it can't be repaired. The higher the ios version, the more bugs, it must be born only to sell more new devices by making the old iphone worse. The current company and its CEO are simply money... money.... money. but it doesn't have any significant improvements like when steven jobs . Touch screen is terrible. it even lost to an old machine, which was born a long time ago, which is the 7 plus . 120hz for what? oled for what? when you press it, and wait for it to respond slowly, 2023 but the screen speed is only 3gs, the battery is too low, can never use 1 day with it, it's all advertising ridiculous scam. The machine is so hot that it bothers me to hold it in my hand, the technology released is just outdated. If the company feels self-respecting, it shouldn't sell phones anymore, before the company can do the simplest things with consumer demand. If it's just to scam consumers, the company is very successful, but I hope one day soon the apple will crumble and users will turn away from it. I used to appreciate apple products very much. I buy most of the products when the apple comes out.

785,"Apple doesn't care about quality or the customerI had such a bad experience today at the Apple Store in the Galleria, and feel so hurt, disrespected, and misled by the way I've been treated over a period of time, by multiple Apple employees -- most recently Nick Ehrman, the Genius Bar supervisor at the Apple Store in the St. Louis Galleria -- that I feel compelled to share my experience with others and discourage them from buying Apple products, unless they too want to be left with devices that are broken by design and that Apple refuses to stand behind and fix.I have a 2016 MacBook Pro. I learned only in 2020 (not from Apple contacting me upfront, but from being contacted by an attorney associated with a class action settlement) that my computer was covered under the terms of a repair program to address a design flaw with the ""butterfly keyboard"" that caused keys to become stuck and/or unresponsive (Apple has since discontinued the butterfly keyboard for this reason). I then called Apple Support, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, and confirmed that my computer's serial number was among those covered. I requested a mail in repair, but was told that I needed to bring it into the store because the repair was not eligible for shipping. I said I was not willing to take it to the store at the risk of my health (this was still pre-vaccine, when nearly everyone was doing their best to stay inside), and so I offered to pay the cost of shipping. I was told I still could not do this, and needed to take it into the store. This made me feel like Apple was adopting a tactic to reduce the likelihood of people actually getting their repair done -- and therefore, to reduce Apple's costs -- which bothered me and reduced my trust in Apple. However, I was told on that same phone call that because my device was covered, I was covered in perpetuity and could bring my device in for repair in the future whenever I felt comfortable doing so. So I accepted the situation, and decided to wait until the Covid emergency was declared over to bring it in again.Fast forward to today, June 27, 2023, less than two months after the federal government declared an end to the pandemic emergency (May 5). I took my computer to the Apple Store in St. Louis Galleria to get the faulty keyboard fixed, and after hearing my problem, the ""genius"" pulled up an Apple website and told that me the program had ended and that my computer could no longer be fixed. I explained the circumstances above -- that I had been promised a fix at whatever point I felt comfortable, and that the problem itself was the result of acknowledged faulty design by Apple -- and asked that an exception be made to cover the repair. They told me at the Apple Store that they could not (Genius bar manager) and would not (store manager) make an exception, and told me Customer Support could. I called Customer Support this evening, spoke to a senior advisor, explained the situation, and he, too, told me that not only could he not make an exception, he could not refer me to anyone who could, and that the repair would not be covered under any circumstances.I have been buying Apple products only for nearly 25 years. When I got married, I started buying them for my wife. When I had a child, I started buying them for my daughter. Over this time, I have seen the quality of Apple products decline and its ""it just works"" software become less functional and intuitive, but I have stuck with Apple because of brand loyalty and because Apple has generally fixed problems in good faith when something went wrong. In this case, that good faith has disappeared and been replaced by what I consider cynical bad faith, with several levels of Apple employees providing wrong information and refusing (or being unable) to take accountability and initiative for a product that was flawed upon purchase, and which the company had already committed to fix at my convenience.The bottom line is that I'm stuck with a broken computer that was doomed to fail when I first took it out of the box. If this sounds fair to you, by all means buy Apple, as I have for a quarter century. If not, join me in buying elsewhere, as I plan to do from here on out.",1,0.112,0.799,0.089,-0.9452

831,"Most Greedy and Disrespectful Business I have ever seen!!After purchasing a phone for my daughter last year within a short month it started giving me problems. I took it back to the site where I purchased it and I was told I needed an ESIEM and the physical SIEM was causing the issues. A week after that the phone screen turned green with lines down it then went completely black. I called Apple who lied to me and said they were sending a loaner until it was repaired. I received nothing not even a box to send the phone in. I then called them back to have them make an appointment at the nearest Apple Store which is an hour away and when I left work early to drive all the way there they set the appointment up for a shopping appointment not a repair appointment so I was sent on my way. I called again to set another appointment and this time they found a Best Buy that was 7 minutes from my house. I again left work early to drive there to be told they can’t help me because they phone needs to be sent in and there is a mail in ticket already open as they failed to cancel it. So I was once again sent away. I called back in again to talk about my options to get this phone repaired and they refused to talk to me as my minor daughters iCloud account is in her name. Completely ridiculous as the phone is in my name and I pay for it. We got that resolved and they mailed me a box to send the phone in. They repaired it to send it back for it to have the same issue shortly after. I had to call to send it back in for a second time for the same issue. Within a month it was doing the same thing again. This time when I called in they said if it does the same thing after the third repair I will get a replacement phone. Well they will not fix the phone as they are claiming it now has water damage which is absolutely not true and if it does did not come from my end. The customer service person I talked to after calling in when I received the email claiming this agreed it was very strange they didn’t see water damage the first or second time they opened the phone but rather the third time and it has hit the year mark of owning the phone so there no longer are any warranties etc. They refused to help me and refused to let me talk to a manager and disconnected the call. I then emailed the CEO, CFO AND COO of Apple for neither of them to reach out but someone from their office to reach out. He claimed he was going to investigate this issue and get back to me. I asked him what I should do about the phone as I was unsure what would happen if I didn’t answer them about what to do with the phone. He said there should be a date that I have to answer by which was not specified anywhere on the email that I screenshot for him. He said he extended the time frame so I wouldn’t have to worry until this issue was resolved. A few days later I received an email from them saying they were sending the phone back to me I not repaired. I reached back out explaining my concern and he said he extended it so he was unsure as to why that happened. He then explained I would have an answer by the end of the week as to what the outcome will be. He reached back out two days later and told me they will not be replacing the phone as the technician shown there was water damage and disregarded everything else. When I asked him to speak with someone higher than him as he seemed to not care either he told me I could not speak to anyone else as he was assigned to the case and this is the final result. Apple is the absolute worst and they are very sad people to treat customers the way they do by lying to them, hanging up on them, not resolving any of their issues, as well as not acting if they got ripped off or taken care of. I would never recommend Apple products to anyone and as soon as I can get the money I will be switching all of our laptops, phones etc over to Samsung and taking out business elsewhere that is not so greedy and rude!",1,0.102,0.863,0.035,-0.9946

839,"Never Buy Apple Products in IndiaAs an avid user of Apple products, I feel compelled to share my extremely disappointing experience with Apple's service center in India. I strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing any Apple product or Apple Care within the country. The level of service provided is abysmal, to say the least, and it is disheartening to witness the complete lack of accountability, especially when it comes to warranty claims.Let me provide you with an account of my own ordeal. Despite my AirPods Pro being well within the warranty period and experiencing a manufacturing issue, the service center deliberately delayed addressing the problem until the warranty had expired. It has been a relentless battle since April, continuously following up with them, only to be met with empty promises and a complete disregard for proper tracking and skilled technicians. Astonishingly, major cities lack dedicated Apple service centers, and instead, rely on third-party facilities. Even if your product is under warranty, don't expect a replacement, as you would in the US or UK.Adding insult to injury, the treatment received from Apple's service personnel is utterly disrespectful, as if owning a premium product does not warrant attention or respect. It bewilders me that there seems to be a lack of a proper tracking mechanism within Apple's international care system. It appears that no matter the exorbitant amount one may spend on an Apple product in India, even if it requires repairs the very next day or if a manufacturing defect arises, one might as well consider it a lost cause. Offering them a year for service or expecting a replacement is futile.If you happen to be reading this, I implore you to heed my words and refrain from purchasing an Apple product in India. I have personally suffered the consequences of my hard-earned money going to waste. I encourage you to explore various forums on Apple in India, where you will find countless individuals grappling with similar issues regarding Apple's service standards. Unless you manage to escalate your concerns to Apple's international care team, the situation in India is unlikely to change. Protect your finances by avoiding Apple products in the Indian market.",1,0.115,0.788,0.097,-0.807

Select - Timeline 	1.	Tuesday 16th May 23 - placed the order for an iPhone 14 Pro Max in purple with Mitch, in the presence of my wife, taking advantage of the special offer of a £433 in part exchange for my old iPhone Pro Max 256 GB which he examined and satisfied himself very well looked after, no scratches whatsoever. Mitch asked me to check a week before 01st June	2.	Tuesday 06th June - Mitch attended to the lengthy paperwork for credit agreement with Klarna - explained to me how he was disappointed with the credit broker changing terms and conditions without good communication: part exchange value reduced to £314 but, offering 0% interest instead. Mitch told me he was offering me £73 as a gesture of goodwill (not seen in the paperwork). It was past closing time. I therefore agreed to come on Thursday 08th about 3.30pm as Mitch was not in on Friday 	3.	Mitch did not give me any paperwork, which he kept in a hold-all bag underneath the counter, otherwise I would have noticed the big mistake! 	4.	Thursday 08th - I was in Select by 3.30pm to find Mitch serving another customer, therefore, Scot was asked to serve me. When he took the new iPhone out of the box only I discovered it was not the pro max I ordered. Mitch denied it, saying it was a pro !	5.	In hindsight, I wish I stood my ground to insist Mitch re-order the correct model for me and kept my old iPhone pro max till the new one arrived!	6.	Scot proceeded to transfer the data to the iPhone 14 pro and I finally left the shop, feeling very upset, again past closing time.	7.	After I got back home, I felt deeply disappointed with the feel of the new iPhone given its smaller size and not comfortable with it at all!	8.	I have lost my yahoo emails completely and Barclays mobile app on the new iPhone!	9.	Friday 09th - I telephoned early morning when Natalie answered. I explained in detail my complete dissatisfaction to be sold a different model to what I ordered. She listened carefully and promised to refer the issues to her line manager, reassuring she would get back to me before closing time on Monday 12th June.	10.	Monday -12 June: Natalie telephoned me with shocking news: she was brushing aside the big mistakes made by Mitch placing the wrong order, offering me totally unacceptable terms: losing -15% of the value of the iPhone 14 pro, my having to reapply for another loan agreement with Klarna, credit broker who she said may take a very long time etc. 	11.

873,"Do NOT buy your phone from APPLEI was completely ripped off by an Apple employee!! She was very nice and bubbly all while she was ‘setting me up’! I was getting 3 ‘upgraded’ phones and I saw all these deals for FREE Apple 14 phones. I asked if I should go through my service provider and she ASSURED ME she could offer me the same deal. I asked if we were on a recorded line, several times and I kept asking “Are you sure these will all be for free!!” To which she advised each time, YES and YES!! (Yes, recorded line and yes, phone will be free.) Fast forward…I receive the phones and the necessary return boxes for my phones. New phones set up, old phones sent back in their “provided mailers”. I now wanted a phone case and went to At+t. The guy in the store brings up my account and asks why didn’t I go into the store so that I could have gotten all 3 phones for FREE?! I told him there were supposed to be for free. He said no, Apple gave me a trade-in value only for $200 per phone and I am financing the balance of each phone!! WHAT?!!! I went home and contacted Apple immediately and after going back and forth and over 2 hours on the phone - I got NO WHERE!! I asked for a supervisor and told them to pull the recorded line and I gave him the representative’s name I worked with, even the email address she gave me to use in the future, because I told her I would be getting a 4th phone, for my husband in the near future. Supposedly they reviewed the recording, but there was nothing they could do for me! I told them I wanted my old phones back and I would cancel this order and go into At+t and deal with them directly. I was then told they ‘destroy’ the phones once received and there was no way they could do that. Bottom line…DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE from APPLE directly…go through your provider. APPLE sucks and so does their customer service!! BUYER BEWARE!And if you have to contact them, hang up FAST if you get a person named MS COOPER. (She would not give me her first name, I should have realized it would be a scam then, but I didn’t because she seemed very kind.

874,"Absolute terrible customers serviceAbsolute terrible customers service. I lost the charging case for my Airpods Pro 2 yesterday. Alternatively I tried to charge my Airpods Pro 2 in the charging case of my older Airpods Pro 1. That didn't work. So I went to the Apple store in Amsterdam today to buy a new charging case for my Airpods Pro 2. They needed the serial number. But after checking my bluetooth connection on my phone for the Airpods Pro 2, the customer support employees discovered that this was the exact same serial number as from my Airpods Pro 1. The fact that I tried to charge my Airpods Pro 2, in the charging case of my Airpods Pro 1, automatically changed the serial number of the Airpods Pro 2 on my iPhone, to the serial number of the Airpods Pro 1. The customer support insisted that they needed the serial number before I could buy a new charging case. But there was no way for them to find that serial number. I called with Bol.com, where I bought the Airpods 2. They also could not tell me what the serial number is. I have the original receipt from Bol.com, but that also does not mention the serial number. The 2 serial numbers from the Left and Right Airpods Pro 2 itself, were still visible on my iPhone. But the customer support said they could not use those serial numbers to find the serial number from charging box, because the charging box has a separate serial number. So I asked them how are we going to resolve this. I need a new charging case, otherwise I cannot use my Airpods Pro 2, and I need them for work next week. They refused to sell me a charging case. They kept repeating that they need that serial number. The serial number I don't have. Because Apple changes the serial number on my iPhone if I put the Airpods in another charging case. How was I suppose to know that. Half of the employees of the 'Genius Bar' did not know that. Then the manager tried to put the blame in my shoes, that I would been better if I made the purchase with them directly, and not with Bol.com (one of the biggest retailers in NL) + that I should not have put the Airpods Pro 2 in the Airpods Pro 1 charging case. Even half of their Genius Bar support staff was unaware of this fact. How was I suppose to know this, they look exactly the same! I said that I wanted to hear a solution from them. That just saying we cannot help you is not a solution. They offered me a minor discount on a new set of Airpods, which costs ~300 euro. Instead of a new charging case, which cost 120 euro. Totally unacceptable. It is the extreme arrogance and complete unwillingness to find a suitable solution for a customer that really sticks. They think they can be really arrogant and give dreadful service because they have a monopoly. I just looked Apple up here on Truspilot, to see what other people's experiences are with Apple. They get a 1-star rating from 70% of reviews; +5.000 1-star reviews in total. No reactions from Apples staff on the complaints there. They don't see the need. That says it all I think.

We normally buy all the products in-store and this is the first time we tried home delivery. It will be the last to deal with Apple ever again. Apple used UPS for delivery my phone which I paid for in full - total of $1800.00 - but I've never receive the phone. I suspect the UPS delivery woman stole my phone because she parked in front of our house for a while then rushed the box to my dad and left in a hurry. On the UPS tracking website it said that signature required but she never asked for signature and we did not sign anything. 15 mins later, we open the box and found out it is an empty box (which was not completely sealed, there was no tape on both sides of the box), nothing in there. We contacted both Apple and UPS but both parties kept kicking the ball and no one take the case into serious investigation. Apple refused to refund me the money. Both parties caused me so much stress and anxiety without doing anything to protect their consumer. I lost $1800.00 and left with fury. I shared the story on Facebook page of my neighborhood. My neighbor said they lost their MacBook the same way but they got refunded. Seems like Apple and UPS treated us differently because of our skin color.

884,"You have to buy a new product to regain access to your account if you lose the security question info.I realized it had been a while since I logged into my Apple account. I really only have ever used it for iTunes, I had an iPod for many years and only stopped using it when it could no longer download apps, but I was thinking about looking at their phones since some of my family have them and like them. My account was locked, which was easily remedied. But then I was locked out because I can't remember the security questions I created for this account when I was 15... 15 years ago. I tried the ""reset the security questions"" link & was brought to a page that said  ""Cannot Reset Security Questions We don’t have sufficient information to reset your security questions.""I contacted support, & was told that I needed a new apple device to gain control of an account I made *without* an apple device.

I have already spoken with two customer assistants for HOURS on the phone, I am talking to a manager, Ilay, however you write it, right now but he apparently can't solve the problem either. The original problem was that I keep on getting this pop up saying that I have a virus. More than two hours afterwards, we had to change both the passwords of my laptop and Apple ID. We managed to change the one for my laptop but my Apple ID was unsuccessful. And then is when the true nightmare began.I went to the shop directly and spoke to the ""Genius"" technician. At some point I know that he changed some password somewhere, I don't know where or why, but he put apple just as the password somewhere, and he left it at that. I WASTED all Sunday in the shop, but I couldn't stay there for so long, oh no. Apple doesn't want frustrated and unhappy customers in the shop-they might put off other customers. Of course not, even when they are being absolutely incompetent at problems they created. So I had to spend one hour waiting in the mall doing nothing until I could come back so that the guy tried to recover the password once again. By the way, while this Genius guy was at it, he changed all the settings: no alarms for some reason, the light on my screen turned off for some reason, so I had to call AGAIN so that another person helped me to put everything right again. Anyway, it didn't work again, so I had to wait almost a month to get a six digit thing sent to my phone and recover my apple account. Did it work today? Oh, no. Of course not. So I called again customer services. Somebody called Ilay who said he was a manager was giving me instructions, but half the time I didn't even know what password he was talking about, what he was describing. The guy looked bored as hell, but I was not bored, I was angry and upset. In the end he was no help at all and clueless. He is puzzled why the system keeps on asking me for a password of a different computer that I never had. So I cannot have any updates, so my personal and banking data is going to be at risk more and more. This is my first computer and I can tell you right now that is going to be the last.In the end, according to this guy, it's all my fault, because I don't know all my previous passwords. Who is going to remember old, changed passwords? What am I supposed to remember those? When you change passwords, the old ones get invalidated. But not with Apple, and somehow this is all my fault, according to Manager Ilya that has not helped at all. But not with Apple. They wanted me to remember old passwords to see if one of them works. Meanwhile, there is no solution: I am still being pestered with virus warnings and the what not, I cannot get updates, the system is asking me for passwords for 'the other computer' that doesn't exist and never existed and Apple couldn't care less. If anybody is thinking about changing to an apple phone or laptop, I would recommend them to stick with Windows. I more than two decades with Windows I never had such a problem with them, maybe with the cheap HP laptops I used to buy, but not with Windows. STICK WITH WINDOWS, FOLKS!!! Apple is not what the hype says it is.",1,0.118,0.817,0.065,-0.9908
891,"Apple are disgraceI have reverted to Apple technologies in the past 5 years from Microsoft - IBM. I own an iMac 2019 Intel desktop, iPhone 14 Pro max, iPad 11"" Pro, M2 Pro Mac Mini, and a series 7 Apple watch, and a heap of accessories all of which are Apple branded. The iPhone and the iPad are about the best of the eco system. I wanted to award Apple only one star but admittedly some of their products are quite good. My focus of this review is more to do with the iMac 2019 and the Mac Mini. The 2019 intel iMac came with host of unforeseen issues, I bought this computer because I am disabled / diabetic etc, and the university recommended an Apple computer as it would come preloaded with software to assist me in completing a Masters degree. The software on the desktop did not work and to get it to work like it should have, there were additional steps that neither me or the tutor who came to my home were aware of, it was an added layer of a learning curve to which I did not need at a time when I required a computer that was supposedly easy to use. After I had completed my second degree successfully, the search for employment began, as you would expect, in the time that I have had the iMac desktop I have lost 4 job opportunities, this is due to the way MS Teams that for some unknown reason locks into a weird loop when there is an attempt to use it, when you speak to Apple Tech support they tell you that due to MS Teams being a third party software that it has nothing to do with them, it is like Apple is not designed to run third party softwares which everyone knows that is complete and utter rubbish, the real reason for them not assisting is because they do not know about their own product well enough to advise accordingly. The iMac desktop issues did not end there, saving MS Word documents became an ordeal as well, because for some reason, the amendments would not save and when they did the entire document was lost somewhere in a file. So iMac desktop is garbage, and the tech support is not much better, they will fob you at a drop of a hat, to get out of doing a job they are paid for! Then we come to the Mac Mini which was an infuriating buys experience - this is surrounding the compatibility of displays, mainly their own 2019 iMac desktop display. Apple has removed the Target Display Mode from before 2014 so the iMac 2019 cannot be used a display for the Mac Mini, this is a fact, and it was something that was constantly contradicted between tech support at Apple and, Apple's own website, no one knew, no one knows, I had to dig up YouTube videos where other buys of this device confirmed that the Mac mini 2023 cannot be used with a 2019 Apple display, ironically, the Mac mini will work with any other display brand ... like Samsung?????? And it will definitely work along side the 1600 quid Mac Studio display, and it will work with any Mac desktop from BEFORE 2014. By then I had already bought and paid for this device, I am going on for teacher training early next year and I need an updated computer that will serve my current eco system so it was an arm twist in having to buy this device. The thing with Apple is that their claims on their own products are stated in half sentences or omitted completely, this serves as misleading and contemptible. If you buy a desktop with Apple make sure you do all of the back ground research before opting to pay for it. I have yet to feel delight, joy and satisfaction with an Apple product without having to buy this, that and the other for it to get proper functionality out of the device. When compared to Android, Microsoft - Apple's only advantage is in its security features and built in privacy, but then as a consumer you should expect this due to Apple Pay. I have taken Apple to the ASA over what I truly believe to be a misleading sale on the Mac mini computer. There was one problem with the iPhone 12 Pro Max that I owned a last year before upgrading, the screen display for some peculiar reason magnified, the phone became inoperable as a result, in an attempt to get the handset back to normal the phone automatically called the Police three times, in the end the local constabulary contacted me to issue a formal warning that if I attempted any further hoax calls I would be subject to a prosecution! Jony Ives says using iPhone is ""intuitive"" that is his way of saying that it is common sense - I can tell you there was nothing intuitive about having to revive a screen on a phone that had by itself enlarged the display, for what reason would you require this feature on a handset? I had to use three fingers, then tap, and the screen would restore itself- not exactly intuitive if you didnt know.

910,"Chinese Tim been a disaster for AppleI purchased an iPhone 14 Pro on the 4th of May (23). I soon discovered that it auto-locks in 75 seconds, regardless of the setting. There was also a problem with the screen not being responsive in all areas. I called Apple twice, used their live chat, and finally took the phone to their ""Genius Bar"" on day 8 of the purchase, their ""expert"" reset the phone and said she timed it, and it works- a complete trickster that I shouldn't have trusted! On returning home, I discovered the phone was exactly as before going to Apple. Called Apple on day 10, and they agreed to send a replacement. The process of sending the phone back and getting a replacement was a stressful week because of the subcontractors Apple are using: Collecting the phone, nowhere on the paperwork said it was Apple, and all the printed references were theirs. Even the tracking number was for delivery of the label and not for tracking the phone back to them. They only acknowledged they received the phone after I managed to contact them and complain. On the 19th of May, Apple was telling me they had processed my order, and the replacement would be with me on 16 May (three days before!)After all that time wasted for both Apple and me and the cost that Apple incurred, the new phone is defective, exactly as the first was!As I see it, Apple products are made glossy outside, but it's Chinese crap inside. I haven't had anything other than Apple products in the past 20 years. If they can't keep their customer base, they're finished, and I blame it all on Chairman Tim Cook",1,0.086,0.905,0.009,-0.9572

On trip 4 to the Victoria Square Belfast store I was finally guaranteed that the problem was fixed and after approximately an hour and a half of leaving the store it froze again leaving me totally stranded without a phone which is  unresponsive on almost a daily basis and sometimes the phone going down for 5 days at a time which is very inconvenient especially as we travel away from home on a regular basis and on a recent trip to Japan I was left stranded without a  phone. On a positive note I do have to say except for the Philippines everyone has been so pleasant and very courteous and most certainly not their fault that they have not been trained and are very sympathetic.Today  my new Apple IPhone 14 Pro Max has finally given up and totally unresponsive. Being gifted with immense patience and after almost 9 months of wasted hours and days my patience has slowly started running out. As recent as  2 days ago I spent around 3 hours on the phone being pushed from pillar to post from one so called genius to another  which started in Albania and moved to Cork who incidentally very conveniently dropped my case recently who were of no help  and then back to Albania again to the so called Senior team to have one of them say they will call me tomorrow but now that the phone is now permanently unresponsive I can’t see that happening which I did tell him would happen. It has been months of false promises and of numerous Case ID’s being opened and never followed up despite promising they would take full responsibility only to totally ignore them and drop the cases as they don’t have a clue how to fix this rubbish I phone 14 Pro Max at a totally extortionate device costing a ridiculous £1,400 which doesn’t work .It’s absolutely no surprise if you look up Apple reviews to discover that EVERY person in recent months has put up a 1 out of 5 stars as that’s the Lowest that Trust Pilot allow you go. So it’s now looking like a 5th wasted journey to the Victoria Square Belfast store which incidentally is not convenient to our home and finally this iPhone 14 Pro Max phone will be handed back which no doubt they will offloaded to some other Poor Unfortunate Soul.

The apple genius bar report stated ""phone not providing any cellular service-diagnostics run on the device and flagged internal cellular Rf failure. No issues found with regards to physical damage/liquid damage or customer misuse. Advised due to internal issues the phone should be replaced.John Lewis' response was as follows;With regards to your main concern, that being your claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 over your Apple iPhone 11, I have reviewed your case and consulted with the team responsible for assessing customer claims. Regrettably, I must inform you that they have advised that we reject your claim at this time. The reason for this is that the Genius Bar report does confirm that there is a fault currently with the device, but there is no mention that the fault is inherent with the device or components wherein. Therefore you do not have a valid claim in this circumstance. They are refusing to budge on this stance.I called the apple store again who advised that this scenario is not unusual with John Lewis and they advised me to contact Apple support as the manufacturer of the device to see if they would honour the device under the consumer rights act 2015. They refused to do so stating that the retailer is responsible.I am now in possession of a supposedly high quality device that cost me £725 two and a half years ago that is not economically worth repairing [the device is sealed and `Apple quoted £475 for the repair].

It had a 3-year warranty I was not able to visit the store again until this April 2023, because of Covid. On the first visit I was misinformed that the Disk had a 5-year warranty, so it was still valid. On my second visit they said that it was a 3-year warranty, and not valid. They of course had asked for a receipt, which I did not have, I had a receipt for mouse, which I purchased at the same time as the Disk. They checked their records and could find the receipt they said they had send me at the time. How did they except me to have the receipt if they could not find it in their records!Initially in China you have to contact the Disk manufacturer to get a refund or replacement. Because they could not find the emailed receipt on their system (which is surprising) they would not take it further to help me with the manufacturer. I believe I had a valid case for a replacement disk or refund. The manager refused to help. They kept apologising, which I said was of no use to me.

I called Apple immediately and in a condescending manner the representative is trying to say one of my kids did it NO they are adults and have their own products and would never use my debit card without permission. The representative kept asking my daughters name and if she goes by any other name NO, this tells me they have a name of the person who did this and that the person was a female I asked who the person is and what did they purchase. I’m still in shocked over his answer “I cannot provide you this information due to privacy” WHAT!! I had whiplash with that comment, this is not the medical field and isn’t a HIPPA compliance this is someone using MY checking account without my permission his next response was “we apple protects everyone’s privacy” I said this is absolutely insane to me, someone can use my debit card and I’m not allowed to know who the person is and he also told me due to privacy he couldn’t tell me what was purchased. I said so Apple protects criminals and he said yes. Am I in the twilight zone here. I asked to speak with the manager was transferred to Steve I am explaining everything to him (and of course I am upset this is almost $400) Steve had the audacity to tell me to be quiet and they are not going to give me this information, patronizingly says to me I’m not giving you the name so let’s just say criminal has used your card and they bought things that we will not tell you what was purchased.

My current iphone is currently being affected by what I have been told are Battery Bugs. The phones battery percentage goes up and down all over the show and then switches itself off for no reason. This is infuriating for someone who has spent a lot of money on Apple products, believing that if I looked after the product then it would last me a long time, apparently not, it lasts as long as Apple want it to, then it is killed off with updates.My iphone is more than just a phone to me because it monitors my blood sugars via a Dexcom One blood sugars monitoring device that i wear. I need my iphone to keep track of what is happening to my blood sugars and then suddenly a good battery percentage reduces to 1% and the phone then shuts itself off leaving me not knowing what is going on inside my body.It personally feels like they kill off old products on purpose with these updates to force you to update your product and spend more money with them.For a company that is so big, you would expect better.",1,0.104,0.796,0.1,-0.3125

Apple advised me at the start of this that if this is the case (that the MacBook is lost) that they will provide a new one. Apple however has no interest in getting it done, and every time they call they say no update, and I need it for work. I have had it confirmed to me three times over the last 8 days by UPS.

Unfortunately, it didn't work (some problem with the internet or sth) and she advised to do it at home. I went home and had to cancel the first order attempt and redo it, as you cannot pick up where you left off. I did so successfully and had the financing approved in seconds. A day later Apple says that the order is being processed with an estimated delivery date a month later! After contacting the online customer care they explained that they couldn't do anything to expedite the order, although they understood my frustration. I can understand a delivery date of up to a week, but a month?! This is ridiculous, especially considering that there is no clear information about the length of delivery when you choose financing! If I wanted to cancel and just go and buy it in the shop in cash, I would have to talk to the financing partner and Apple separately of course, which take a long time too.

988,"Long time loyal Apple  customer now saying...Something very wrong with Apple and specifically the staff at Apple Chadstone Victoria.I've been struggling with a sticky H key on my 2017 Apple MacBook Pro. At first, the issue was sporadic, but it quickly escalated to a point where it became unbearable. After researching online, I discovered that this was a widespread issue affecting all models featuring the 'new butterfly type keyboard' introduced in 2015. This keyboard has caused a lot of problems, especially regarding the issue I encountered. A quick search online reveals endless complaints, and it's gotten so bad that Apple has officially acknowledged the problem and created a fix, in addition to settling a $50 million dollar class action claim for the very same issue.When I went to the Apple Genius Bar at Chadstone, I met with Dave, who visually and physically examined my MacBook Pro and suggested that the issue was  probably some dirt stuck under the key. But after five minutes, Dave returned with a wry smile and told me that the key was broken. He quickly added that it would be too expensive to fix at AUD$1000 and it wasn't worth it. The key was no longer stuck, but it was broken. I confronted Dave, and he said that all he did was blow compressed air under the key.I spoke to the store manager and asked him to review the CCTV footage of our interactions. After seeing it, he agreed with everything I claimed. But, he maintained that all Dave did was wipe the keyboard with a cloth and blow compressed air. I asked the manager if he agreed that the H key looked damaged and broken, sitting lower than any other key on the keyboard, and he said it did. So, I asked why Dave didn't identify it during the initial inspection. The manager then offered to split the damage bill 50/50, but I declined and reported the issue to Apple directly the next day.Apple Australia responded, but their response was disappointing. They sided with the Apple Store staff regarding this matter. It's frustrating to encounter such a widespread known issue, and even more disappointing to receive such an unsatisfactory response from Apple Genius Chadstone, refusing to take responsibility for making my initial well publicised butterfly keyboard fault claim  null and void by completely breaking the keyboard and leaving me in the hole with at least a $500 repair bill which they kindly accepted a partial responsibility for their negligence.

This damage doesn't exist - the phone hasn't ever left the case. It's immaculate. £400 is the price of a new low-end iPhone.This is compounded by the anti right to repair practices by Apple, basically making it impractical or impossible to do the repair myself or get a third party company to fix it.

So the choice is this: - pay the price of a new phone for a battery replacement - buy a new phone In this case I bought the cheap SE as it was pointless getting old hardware repaired. But this is an interim solution while I migrate to Android. I won't buy another iPhone after this - even less so a flagship model. Well done Apple.

Before this I wanted to buy extended coverage which I had 1 week left to do- but I can’t because the device won’t power on. I took it to the store. They told me 3-5 business days to get a full replacement delivered to my door. 5 days later my status hasn’t moved so I check in with their chat after getting support on the phone who transferred me to the store where the phone rang for 11 minutes before they disconnected my call. Chat tells me it takes 3-5 days for them to receive my device and 3-5 days to test it and then 3-5 days to return it. I’m just absolutely disgusted with this entire process. Apple products have taken a nose dive and their service can barely be called service.,1,0.029,0.92,0.051,0.404
